\chapter{\texorpdfstring{Search for \Htohhtobbtautau}{Search for H -> hh -> bbtautau}}
\label{sec:hhh}

In this chapter the search for a heavy Higgs boson decaying to a pair of 125 GeV Higgs bosons, with one of these Higgs bosons decaying to 
a pair of b-jets and the other decaying to a pair of \Ptau leptons is discussed. This \Pgt-pair final states studied in this analysis
are the \etau, \mutau and \tautau channels. The results of this search are model-independent
upper limits on heavy Higgs production cross--section times branching ratio into h(125)h(125)$\rightarrow b\bar{b} \tau\tau$, which use
combine all three channels. The \etau and \mutau channels will be described in this chapter, the \tautau channel will not
be covered. In addition  the results are interpreted in the context of the MSSM and a type-II Two Higgs Doublet Model (2HDM), 
these interpretations are made in combination with the results of a search for \AtoZhtolltautau. 
This search will be summarised in this chapter, but will not constitute the main focus.
Both searches, and their interpretation, are detailed in reference \cite{CMS-HIG-14-034}.

The discovery of the 125 GeV Higgs boson by the ATLAS and CMS collaborations in 2012 \cite{HDiscoveryAtlas,HDiscoveryCMS} has opened up
new possibilities for probing the Higgs sector beyond the Standard Model. In some MSSM scenarios, and some more
generic type-II 2HDM's, a heavy neutral Higgs boson H can decay to a pair of 125 GeV Higgs bosons for low values
of \tanb, probing a region of phase space not yet excluded by stringent existing limits. In regions where
the decay \Htohh is enhanced, the \AtoZh decay also has a large branching ratio, indicating the usefulness
of both channels for probing the low-\tanb region. The $b\bar{b}$\tautau final state is chosen for the combination
of the large $h(125) \rightarrow b\bar{b}$ branching ratio and the cleaner \htotautau final state.

\section{Datasets and Monte Carlo samples}
\label{sec:hhh_datasets}
The dataset used for this analysis corresponds to the full dataset collected by the CMS experiment during the 2012 $p-p$ 
running period of the LHC. 
Signal and background events were generated using several different MC event generators. The \texttt{MadGraph}
\cite{madgraph} matrix element generator was used to generate samples of \Wjets, \Zellell, \ttbar and \ZZ ,\WZ and \WW
events. In addition to samples with a mixture of jet multiplicities ('inclusive' samples), samples binned in jet multiplicity
were used for the \Wjets and \Zellell backgrounds. This increases the number of background events
in signal regions with multiple jets. The samples binned in jet multiplicity are combined with the
inclusive samples such that the fraction of events with each jet multiplicity is preserved.

Single top samples were produced with the \texttt{POWHEG} \cite{powheg1,powheg2} generator. Samples of $gg\rightarrow$\Htohhtobbtautau
were generated in steps of 10 GeV between \mH $= 260 - 350$~GeV using \texttt{PYTHIA 6} \cite{pythia64}. In all of the samples
\texttt{TAUOLA} \cite{tauola} is used to decay $\tau$s, and parton showering and hadronisation are modelled using \texttt{PYTHIA 6} \cite{pythia64}.
Minimum bias events generated using \texttt{PYTHIA 6} are added to all MC samples to model additional
interactions. 

To better model the \Ztautau background, an embedding technique is used. In this method, 
\Zmm events are selected in data and the muons are replaced by generator-level taus. \texttt{TAUOLA} is used
to decay the taus and tau polarisation effectes are modelled using \texttt{TauSpinner} \cite{TauSpinner}. The detector
response to the tau decay products is modelled using the \texttt{GEANT4}-based \cite{Geant4} detector simulation, and 
tracks in the inner tracking system, hits in the muon systems and energy deposits in the calorimeters
due to the simulated taus are combined with the remains of the \Zmm event after the detector signals
of the two muons originiating from the \PZ have been removed. This technique is also applied to 
a \ttbar background samples to estimate the \ttbar contamination in the embedded sample. This contribution
needs to be subtracted from the \Ztautau background estimated using the embedded \Zmm sample to
avoid double counting with the \ttbar monte carlo.


\section{Event selection and categorisation}
\label{sec:hhh_selection}
A more detailed description of the physics objects used for this analysis is given in chapter FIXME:write object reco section, 
in this section only an overview of the event selection is presented.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Event selection in the \mutau channel}{Event selection in the mu-tau channel}}
\label{sec:hhh_selection_mutau}
Events in the \mutau channel are first selected by requiring a muon and a 
hadronic tau. The first step of this selection is a trigger which requires only a muon
at L1. At the level of the HLT a hadronic tau is also required. This is reconstructed
with a simpler version of the PF algorithm, and loose isolation requirements are 
applied. In addition, loose ID and isolation requirements are applied to the muon at 
this stage. 

In the offline event selection, an oppositely charged \mutau pair is required, 
separated by $\Delta R > 0.5$.
The muon is required to have a \pT of at 
least 20 GeV and $|\eta| < 2.1$, and should be compatible with originating from the 
primary vertex. This means the impact parameters $d_{xy}$ and $d_{z}$ must be smaller
than 0.045 and 0.2 cm respectively. Tight muon identification
criteria and tight isolation requirements $I_{\text{rel}}^{\mu} < 0.1$, as described 
in section OBJECTS, are applied. The hadronic tau must have a \pT of at least
20 GeV, $|\eta| < 2.3$, and must have $d_{z} < 0.2$ cm. It is required to pass 
the decay mode finding identification
from the HPS algorithm, as described in section OBJECTS. Additionally
the raw combined isolation, described in the same section, is required to be
at most 1.5 GeV. To reject $\Pe/\Pgm \rightarrow \Pgt_{h}$ fakes, and to
reduce the contribution of \Zmm background events, the hadronic tau is 
also required to pass the tight working point of the anti-$\Pgm$ discriminator
and the loose working point of the cut--based anti-$\Pe$ discriminator, both
described in section OBJECTS.

After this selection there is still a chance more than one possible 
\mutau pair exists
in the event. If this is the case, the combination with largest 
\pT$^{\Pgm}$ + \pT$^{\Pgt_{h}}$ is chosen. In order to reduce \Zmm 
backgrounds further, for cases where the reconstructed hadronic tau originates
from a misidentified jet, the event is rejected if an opposite--charge pair 
of lower \pT (at least 15 GeV) muons, passing looser ID and isolation requirements
than the signal muon, can be formed. Additional vetos, requiring exactly one muon and 
exactly zero electrons to pass \pT $>10$ GeV and tight ID and isolation requirements, 
are applied to reduce the \WZ background. 

In addition to the requirements on the di--tau pair, at least 2 jets with \pT$ >20$ GeV are 
required. No b--tagging requirements are applied at this stage, these will be discussed 
in more detail in section \ref{sec:hhh_selection_categories}.

Figure \ref{fig:Hhh_selection_kinematics_mt} shows some of the kinematic variables 
of di-\Pgt candidates in the \mutau channel

\end{figure}


\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Event selection in the \etau channel}{Event selection in the e-tau channel}}
\label{sec:hhh_selection_etau}
Events in the \etau channel are selected by requiring an electron and a hadronic tau.
As for the \mutau channel the first step of this selection is the trigger, which
requires an electron at L1, and both an electron and a hadronic tau at HLT. The hadronic
tau is reconstructed in a similar way to the \mutau channel, and loose ID and isolation requirements
are also applied to the electron.

Offline, an oppositely charged \etau pair is required, again separated by $\Delta R >0.5$. 
The electron should have a \pT of at least 24 GeV, $|\eta| < 2.1$, and should
satisfy $d_{xy} < 0.045$cm and $d_{z} < 0.2$ cm. The electron must pass the tight
working point of the electron MVA ID discriminator described in section OBJECTS, and the
relative isolation is required to be $I_{rel}^{\Pe} < 0.1$. The requirements placed on the
hadronic tau are similar to those required in the \mutau channel, apart from the anti-$\Pgm$ discriminator,
where the loose working point is required, and the anti--$\Pe$ discriminator, where the medium
working point of the MVA discriminator is required.

If there is more than one possible \etau pair, the pair with largest \pT$^{\Pe}$+\pT$^{\Pgt_{h}}$
is taken. Similar additional vetos as in the \mutau channel are applied.
the event is rejected if an opposite--charge pair of \pT $> 15$ GeV electrons, passing looser ID and
isolation requirements than the signal electron requirements can be formed. To reduce the \WZ
background events that have more than one electron or at least one muon passing \pT $>10$ GeV and tight ID and isolation
requirements are rejected.

In addition to the requirements on the di--tau pair, at least 2 jets with \pT $>20$ GeV are 
required. 

Figure \ref{fig:Hhh_selection_kinematics_et} shows some of the kinematic variables 
of di-\Pgt candidates in the \etau channel

\end{figure}


\subsection{Categorisation}
\label{sec:hhh_selection_categories}
ADD b-jet plots?
In both channels an selection on the transverse mass \mT between the electron/muon
and missing transverse energy, defined as in equation \ref{eqn:hhh_selection_mt}, is applied.

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:hhh_selection_mt}
m_{\text{T}} = \sqrt{2p_{\text{T}}E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}}(1-\cos{\Delta\phi})}
\end{equation}

In this eqation \pT is the transverse momentum of the electron or muon, and $\Delta\phi$ the angle
between the light lepton and the missing transverse energy. The \mT distributions for the \etau
and \mutau channels, using the selections as
described in sections \ref{sec:hhh_selection_mutau} and \ref{sec:hhh_selection_etau},
is shown in figure \ref{fig:Hhh_selection_mt}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\subfloat[\mutau channel]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Hhh/Plots/mt_1_2jetinclusive_mt_2012.pdf}}
\subfloat[\etau channel]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{Hhh/Plots/mt_1_2jetinclusive_et_2012.pdf}}
\end{center}
\caption{\mT distributions in the \mutau (left) and \etau (right) channels}
\label{fig:Hhh_selection_mt}
\end{figure}

In both channels this quantity is required to be smaller than 30 GeV. In events
where the missing energy and the light lepton are oriented back--to--back, \mT is
large, whereas it is closer to zero when the two are aligned. In $\PW\rightarrow\ell\nu$
events, as the W is very heavy, the lepton and neutrino are more likely to emitted back--to--back,
therefore \mT will be large. For \Ztautau and \htotautau events, in a $\tau\rightarrow\ell\nu\nu$ decay 
the neutrinos are more likely to travel in the same direction as the visible decay products of 
the tau, due to the smaller mass of the \Pgt compared with the \PW. Therefore requiring the
transverse mass to be less than 30 GeV reduces the \Wjets background. This effect
is also visible in figure \ref{fig:Hhh_selection_mt}, where the \Wjets and the much
smaller diboson and single-top backgrounds are drawn together as 'electroweak backgrounds'.
%In this analysis the presence of at least 2 jets increases the relative fraction of \ttbar 
%background events. Because the missing energy can now originate from multiple
%heavy objects (two tops) the missing transverse energy alignment is randomised. In some
%cases the lepton and missing transverse energy can be very much like the W decay
%topology, whereas in other cases \mT will be lower

After applying the \mT selection, events are divided into three categories to maximise
sensitivity to the signal: 2jet-0tag (at least 2 jets, exactly 0 of which are b-tagged), 2jet-1tag 
(at least 2 jets, exactly 1 of which is b-tagged), 2jet-2tag (at least 2 jets, at least 2 of which are b-tagged).
The 2jet-0tag category does not collect much of the signal and is dominated by 
backgrounds, the 2jet-2tag category is most sensitive to signal. 
In signal events, the di--tau pair and di--jet pair 
are the decay products of an 125 Gev Higgs boson, therefore their invariant
masses should be close to 125 GeV. To reduce background contributions
from events where the di--tau or di--jet mass is not compatible with
125 GeV, requirements are made on the di--jet invariant mass and the di--tau
invariant mass as reconstructed using the \texttt{SVFit} algorithm (ADD A SECTION ON THIS).
By requiring $70 < m_{jj} < 150 $GeV and $90 < m_{\Pgt\Pgt} < 150$ GeV a 
large number of background events can be rejected, while retaining
most of the signal. This is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:Hhh_selection_masscuts} for 
the 2jet-2tag category.

\section{Data to Monte Carlo correction factors}
\label{sec:hhh_datamc}
Monte Carlo samples are used for the estimation of some of the backgrounds and the signal, 
and it is therefore important to correct for any mismodelling. The data to Monte Carlo
correction factors used for this are estimated in dedicated control regions.

A reweighting is applied to make the pile--up distribution in Monte Carlo
match the distribution observed in data.DESCRIPTION

Data and Monte Carlo identification, isolation, and trigger efficiencies
are measured for electrons, muons and hadronic taus. The difference between
the efficiencies in data and Monte Carlo are applied to Monte Carlo events as a
scale factor $SF = \frac{\epsilon_{\text{Data}}}{\epsilon_{\text{MC}}}$.

For electrons and muons, these scale factors are measured using a 
tag--and--probe method using \Zeenog and \Zmmnog events, respectively.
The hadronic taus identification, isolation and trigger efficiencies
are measured via a similar method that makes use of
$Z\rightarrow\Pgt\Pgt\rightarrow\Pgm\Pgt_{h}$ events.

FIXME: Tau es?

FIXME: top pt reweighting
FIXME: ttbar scale factor

In the \etau channel a data to Monte Carlo scale factor is applied
to the \Zee background, to correct for differences in the $e\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$
fake rate between data and MC. DERIVED HOW

To correct for the difference in b--tagging efficiency and light jet mis--tagging
rates between data and Monte Carlo \pT and $\eta$ dependent scale factors are 
derived using the method described in \cite{BTV8TeV}. There are separate scale factors for 
b-/c- jets and light jets. There are multiple possible ways to apply these
scale factors, for this analysis this is done through a promote/demote method.

In this method a demotion or promotion probability is assigned to every
jet as in equation \ref{eqn:promotedemote}.

\begin{align}\label{eqn:promotedemote}
&P(\text{demote}) = 1 - SF \text{  for SF < 1 }  \notag \\
&P(\text{promote}) = \frac{(SF - 1)(\epsilon_{\text{MC}}-1)}{SF} \text{    for SF > 1}
\end{align}.

In this equation $SF$ is the scale factor mentioned above, and $\epsilon_{\text{MC}}$ is
the b--tagging efficiency in Monte Carlo events for the type of jet (light, b- or c-)
in consideration.



\section{Discriminating variable}
\label{sec:hhh_discr}
The variable of interest in this analysis is the mass of the heavy Higgs boson H. This can be
reconstructed as the 4--body mass of the two jets and the two taus, however
a more accurate result can be obtained by using a kinematic fitting 
procedure that makes use of the 125 GeV mass constraint on the di--tau and
di--jet candidates. 

In a kinematic fit constraints are made on the event kinematics, in the
case of this analysis these constraints are
$m(\Pgt_{1},\Pgt_{2}) = m_{h} = 125 $GeV and
$m(b_{1},b_{2}) = m_{h} = 125 $ GeV.
The kinematic observables related to the hadronic taus and jets
are varied within their uncertainties to fulfill these 
constraints. A $\chi^2$ cost term is introduced for each
observable that is varied with respect to the measurement,
the aim of the fit is to minimise this.

For b-jets, the reconstructed direction in $\eta$ and $\phi$ is 
assumed to be measured accurately in comparison with their energy.
Therefore only the energy is varied in the fit. In addition, we assume
that uncertainties in the energy measurement directly translate to
uncertainties in the momentum measurement, therefore $\vec{\beta} = \vec{p}/E$ is
also kept constant. 

Before the fit, from the mass constraint we have (equation \ref{eqn:kinfit_prefit})

\begin{align}\label{eqn:kinfit_prefit}
m_{h}^2 &= E_{h}^2 - \vec{p_{h}}^2 = (E_{b1}+E_{b2})^2 - (\vec{p_{b1}} + \vec{p_{b2}})^2 \notag\\
& = 2E_{b1}E_{b2} + m_{b1}^2 +m_{b2}^2 - 2\vec{p_{b1}}\vec{p_{b2}} \notag\\
& = m_{b1}^2 +m_{b2}^2 - 2E_{b1}E_{b2}(1-\vec{\beta_{b1}}\vec{\beta_{b2}})\notag\\
\Rightarrow (1-\vec{\beta_{b1}}\vec{\beta_{b2}}) = \frac{m_h^2 - m_{b1}^2 - m_{b2}^2}{2E_{b1}E_{b2}}
\end{align}

When varying the energy of the first jet in the fit, equation \ref{eqn:kinfit_prefit} can be 
rewritten to derive an expression for the updated energy of the second jet. Using $\mathcal{A} = (1-\vec{\beta_{b1}}\vec{\beta_{b2}})$ 
and equation \ref{eqn:gamma_def}:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:gamma_def}
\gamma = \frac{1}{1-\beta^2} \Rightarrow \gamma^2 = \frac{1}{1-\beta^2} = \frac{1}{1-p^2/E^2} = \frac{E^2}{m^2}
\end{equation}

We get:

\begin{align}\label{eqn:kinfit_variation}
m_h^2 &= m_{b1}^2 + m_{b2}^2 - 2E_{b1}E_{b2}(1-\vec{\beta_{b1}}\vec{\beta{b2}}\notag\\
&= m_{b1}^2 +\frac{E_{b2,fit}^2}{\gamma_{b2}^2} +2\mathcal{A}E_{b1}E_{b2,fit}\notag\\
\Rightarrow E_{b2}^{fit}& = \frac{(-2E_{b1}\mathcal{A} + \sqrt{4E_{b1}^2\mathcal{A} - 4(m_{b1}^2-m_{h}^2)\gamma_{b2}^{-2}})\gamma_{b2}^2}{2}\notag\\
&= E_{b1}\mathcal{A}\gamma_{b2}^2+\sqrt{E_{b1}^2\mathcal{A}\gamma_{b2}^4 - (m_{b1}^2 - m_{h}^2)\gamma_{b2}^2}\notag\\
\Rightarrow E_{b2}^{fit} = E_{b1}\mathcal{A}\gamma_{b2}^2(-1 + \sqrt{1+\frac{m_{h}^2 - m_{b1}^2}{E_{b1}^2\mathcal{A}\gamma_{b2}^2}}\\
\end{align}

The fitting procedure additionally modifies the masses of the b-jets as (equation \ref{eqn:kinfit_bjetmass})
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:kinfit_bjetmass}
m_{b_{1,2}}^{fit} = m_{b_{1,2}}\frac{E_{b_{1,2}}^{fit}}{E_{b_{1,2}}}
\end{equation}

For each b-jet a $\chi^2$ term is calculated as $\chi_{b1,2}^2 = \frac{E_{b1,2}^{fit}-E_{b1,2}^{meas}}{\sigma_{b1,2}}$.

For taus only the visible decay products are measured. Assuming the visible decay products of the \Pgt point in 
the same direction as the \Pgt, a similar procedure as for the b-jets can be employed to constrain the mass of the second tau
when varying the mass of the first tau in the fit. The masses of the taus are kept fixed at $m_{\Pgt}$ throughout the procedure.

Due to the missing energy associated with the \Pgt decays, additional constraints
on the fit have to be used to reconstruct the correct tau energies. This is done by 
enforcing that the heavy Higgs boson recoil from the fit is close to the reconstructed recoil.

The measured recoil is (equation \ref{eqn:kinfit_recoilmeas})

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:kinfit_recoilmeas}
\vec{p_{\text{T,recoil}}}^{measured} = -\vec{p_{\text{T,H}}}^{measured} = -\vec{p_{\text{T,miss}}}^{measured} - \vec{p_{\text{T},b_{1}}}^{measured} - \vec{p_{\text{T},b_{2}}}^{measured} - \vec{p_{\text{T},\Pgt_1^{\text{vis}}}}^{measured} - \vec{p_{\text{T},\Pgt_2^{\text{vis}}}}^{measured}
\end{equation}

With the recoil from the fit (equation \ref{eqn:kinfit_recoilfit})
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:kinfit_recoilfit}
\vec{p_{\text{T,recoil}}}^{fit} = -\vec{p_{\text{T,H}}}^{fit} = - \vec{p_{\text{T},b_{1}}}^{fit} - \vec{p_{\text{T},b_{2}}}^{fit} - \vec{p_{\text{T},\Pgt_1}}^{fit} - \vec{p_{\text{T},\Pgt_2}}^{fit}
\end{equation}

A $\chi^2$ corresponding to the agreement between the fitted and measured recoil is reconstructed as (equation \ref{eqn:kinfit_recoilchi2})

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:kinfit_recoilchi2}
\chi^2_{recoil} = (\vec{p_{text{T,recoil}}}^{\text{fit}} - \vec{p_{text{T,recoil}}}^{\text{measured}})^T V_{\text{recoil}}^{-1}(\vec{p_{text{T,recoil}}}^{\text{fit}} - \vec{p_{text{T,recoil}}}^{\text{measured}})
\end{equation}

where the covariance matrix $V_{\text{recoil}}$ of the recoil vector is estimated as in equation \ref{eqn:kinfit_recoilcov} from the covariance matrices of the b-jets and
the covariance matrix of the missing transverse momentum. The latter is estimated in the process of determining the MVA \MET (OBJECT RECO),
while the covariance matrices of the b-jets can be written in terms of position, momentum and resolution of the b-jets. 

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:kinfit_recoilcov}
V_{\text{recoil}} = V_{\vec{p_{\text{T,miss}}}} - V_{b_{1}} - V_{b_2} 
\end{equation}

The total $\chi^2$ term that needs to be minimised in the fit can then be written as (equation \ref{eqn:kinfit_chitot})

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:kinfit_chitot}
\chi^2 = \chi^2_{b_1} + \chi^2_{b_2} + \chi^2_{\text{recoil}}
\end{equation}

The result of the kinematic fit are the tau and b-jet 4-vectors with their energies and momenta
set to the best fit values found for them in the fit. These can then be added together to find
the mass of the heavy Higgs boson as reconstructed by the kinematic fit.

As illustrated in figure \ref{fig:kinfitvsmjj} the use of the kinematic fit greatly
improves the resolution of the reconstructed heavy Higgs mass in signal events, when 
compared with the simple 4-body mass reconstruction. It also shifts the mean of the
distribution closer to the true value. From the right hand side of
figure \ref{fig:kinfitvsmjj} one can see that the mass distribution for
background events is less affected by the kinematic fit, although due to the
invariant mass constraint the minimum of the reconstructed mass distribution
is forced to 250 GeV.

\section{Background estimation}
\label{sec:hhh_backgrounds}
To estimated the shape and yield of backgrounds in this analysis, data--driven techniques are
used where possible. 

\section{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{sec:hhh_uncs}

\section{\texorpdfstring{Overview of \AtoZhtolltautau}{Overview of A->Zh->lltautau}}
\label{sec:hhh_azh}
In this section a summary of the \AtoZhtolltautau analysis, which is combined with the 
analysis described so far for the purposes of model interpretations, is given.

The search for \AtoZhtolltautau also uses the full dataset collected by the CMS experiment during
the 2012 $p-p$ running period of the LHC. In this search the \mumu and \ee final states of the \PZ boson
and the \emu, \etau, \mutau and \tautau channels of the \htotautau decay, leading to a total of
eight final states. 

First the \PZ candidate is chosen as a pair of isolated electrons or muons, with opposite charge, and 
invariant mass of the pair between 60-120 GeV. In case there is more than one possible pair, the 
pair with invariant mass closest to the \PZ mass is chosen. The \htotautau decay is chosen by selecting
an oppositely charged pair of isolated leptons in the four channels mentioned earlier. To ensure no overlap
between different final states is possible, events with additional electrons or muons satisfying the
\pT and $\eta$ requirements are discarded.

To reject some of the backgrounds from misidentified leptons and \ZZ production, a requirement is made
on the scalar sum of the visible transverse momenta of the two $\tau$ candidates from the \htotautau decay.
This selection changes by final state and has been chosen to optimise the analysis sensitivity to an 
\AtoZh signal with \mA $= 220 - 350 $ GeV. Furthermore \ttbar events are discarded by rejecting
events with at least one b-tagged jet. 

Remaining backgrounds from \ZZ, triboson and \ttbar\PZ production are estimated using
Monte Carlo samples. Backgrounds from \PZ+jets %($\ell\ell\tautau$ channel) 
and \WZ+jets %($\ell\ell\mutau$ and $\ell\ell\etau$ channels) 
events, with at least one misidentified lepton, are estimated from control regions in data.

For signal extraction, the mass of the A boson \mA, reconstructed by combining the
4-vector of the \PZ candidate with the 4-vector of the \Ph -candidate,as obtained by using the 
\texttt{SVFit} algorithm. The expected and observed 95\% confidence level upper limits, for
all $\ell\ell\tau\tau$ final states combined, is shown in figure \ref{fig:AZhUpperLimits}

The results of the analysis are interpreted in two scenarios, the low \tanb MSSM
scenario, and a type II two--Higgs doublet model (2HDM). 2HDM's are more general
than the MSSM, are not mativated by supersymmetry, and there are several different types. 
Of these different classes, type II 2HDM's are most studied
as the couplings of the MSSM form a subset of the couplings in type II 2HDMs. 

\subsubsection{Interpretation in a type II 2HDM}
\label{sec:hhh_results_modeldep_2HDM}
A 2HDM of type II has more free parameters than a specified MSSM scenario: the physical masses of the Higgs bosons (\mh, \mH,
\mA, \mHplus), the ratio of the vacuum expectation values of the two Higgs doublets (\tanb),
the CP-even Higgs mixing angle ($\alpha$) and $m_{12}^{2} = m_{\PHiggsps}^{2}[\tan{\beta}/(1+\tan{\beta}^2)]$.
To leave two free parameters, it is enough to fix the masses of the physical Higgs bosons. For this
interpretation the assumption that \mA = \mH = \mHplus = $300$~GeV, and \mh = $125$~GeV, is made.

The couplings of the Higgs bosons to quarks and leptons, and of heavy Higgs bosons to other
particles, are defined by $\alpha$ and $\beta$, as in table \ref{tab:hhh_2HDM_couplings}.

\begin{table}[htdp]
\begin{center}
\caption{Couplings in the type II 2HDM}
\begin{tabular}{@{}ll@{}}
%\toprule
\textbf{Decay} & \textbf{Coupling}\\
\midrule
$\PHiggslight \rightarrow$ up--type quarks & $\text{SM coupling} \times \frac{\cos{\alpha}}{\sin{\beta}}$ \\
$\PHiggslight \rightarrow$ down--type quarks, leptons & $\text{SM coupling} \times -\frac{\sin{\alpha}}{\cos{\beta}}$ \\
$\PHiggs \rightarrow \PHiggslight\PHiggslight$ & $\sim$ \cosba $\times$ terms containing masses,\\
 & mixing angles, quartic couplings \\
$\PHiggsps \rightarrow \PZ\PHiggslight$ & $\sim$ \cosba\\

FIXME: ALIGNMENT LIMIT


The interpretations are made in the \cosba--\tanb plane. Figures \ref{fig:Hhh2HDMOverlaid}
and \ref{fig:AZh2HDMOverlaid} show the observed and expected exclusion at 95\% confidence level for the \Htohh
and \AtoZh analyses respectively, overlaid on the production cross--section times branching ratio.
The exclusion contours have some interesting features, most of which can be explained by the couplings
from table \ref{tab:hhh_2HDM_couplings}. When \cosba=0, in the alignment limit, the couplings
of all particles are exactly standard model--like. This is reflected in the \Htohh and \AtoZh branching ratios, 
which both vanish as \cosba approaches 0. This leads to the corridor of non--exclusion down the 
centre of figures \ref{fig:Hhh2HDMOverlaid} and \ref{fig:AZh2HDMOverlaid}. Additionally,
as the couplings of \PHiggslight to pairs of b--quarks and $\Pgt$ leptons are porportional 
to $\frac{\sin{\alpha}}{\cos{\beta}}$, the branching ratios of \Htohhtobbtautau
and \AtoZhtolltautau vanish when $\alpha = 0$, leading to the corridor of non--exclusion
at \cosba $ > 0$ and low \tanb in the \AtoZh figure. A similar corridor is starting
to become visible in the $\sigma \times BR$ structure of the \Htohh interpretation, but
the analysis is not yet sensitive enough to actually see a full--blown corridor in this
region.
Additional regions of non--exclusion at low \tanb and \cosba near -1 are visible in the \Htohh 
interpretation, these are a result of the complex \Htohh branching ratio (ADD FIGURE).

A combined interpretation of both analyses in this model is presented
in figure \ref{fig:HhhAZh2HDM}. Some of the features discussed earlier
in this section are also visible in this combined interpretation.

\subsubsection{Interpretation in the low \tanb MSSM scenario}
\label{sec:hhh_results_modeldep_lowtb}
The low \tanb MSSM scenario, as discussed in section FIXME: write theory section that mentions this
is an MSSM scenario that has been adapted to allow \mh $=125 \pm 3$~GeV for \tanb values
as low as 1.  

The combined interpretation of both analyses in this model is presented in figure \ref{fig:HhhAZhMSSM}.
The exclusion in this scenario is driven by the \AtoZh search, the \Htohh search is not
very sensitive in this model (see figure FIXME add these plots). At 350 GeV the excluded
region drops off, this is due to the turn--on of the
$\PHiggsps \rightarrow \ttbar$ decay which becomes kinematically allowed in this region, 
sharply decreasing the \AtoZh branching ratio.

the $\pm 1\sigma$ and $2\sigma$ expected exclusion \cite{CMS-HIG-14-034}. The area

GeV and is therefore not accessible.}
