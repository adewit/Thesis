\chapter{\texorpdfstring{Search for MSSM \AHtotautau}{Search for MSSM A/H -->tautau}}
\label{chap:mssm}

In this chapter the search for neutral Higgs bosons \PHiggs or \PHiggsps
decaying to a pair of \Pgt leptons will be discussed. The results presented
here correspond to those from an analysis peformed on 12.9 fb$^{-1}$ collected
at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV during the first half of the 2016 p--p running period of the \ac{LHC}, 
detailed in reference \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037}. The \etau, \mutau, \tautau and \emu final
states of the di-\Pgt pair were studied. The results of this search are 
model--independent upper limits on $\sigma \times$ BR of \PHiggs or \PHiggsps 
production in the two decay modes (see THEORY) and decay into $\Pgt\Pgt$. In 
addition, the results are interpreted in MSSM benchmark scenarios and 2D likelihood
scans of the two production modes are performed. A very similar analysis
was performed on 2.3 fb$^{-1}$ of data collected at $\sqrt{s}=13$ TeV during the 2015 \ac{LHC} p--p running period. 
As it is so similar to the analysis performed on the 2016 dataset it
will not be described in detail here, more information can be found in reference \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-006}.
The results of the 2015 analysis will be shown, in addition to a combination of the 2015 and 2016 datasets.

For the analysis described in this chapter, as well as the 2015 analysis not detailed
here, I was responsible for optimisation of object selection and categorisation,
as well as studies of background methods for the \mutau, \etau and \tautau channels,
evaluation of systematic uncertainties in all four channels, and for producing
the statistical results, including model--dependent interpretations.

\section{Datasets and MC samples}
\label{sec:mssm_datasets}
The dataset used for this analysis corresponds to an integrated 
luminosity of 12.9 fb$^{-1}$ collected at a centre--of--mass
energy of 13 TeV during the first half of
the 2016 p--p running period of the \ac{LHC}. Section
\ref{sec:mssm_combination} includes the combination of this
dataset with a dataset collected during the 2015 p--p running
period of the \ac{LHC}. This dataset corresponds to an integrated
luminosity of 2.3 fb$^{-1}$ collected at $\sqrt{s} = 13$ TeV.

Signal and background events were generated using
various \ac{MC} event generators. Signal samples
for the $\Pg\Pg \rightarrow \phi$ and $\Pg\Pg \rightarrow b\bar{b}\phi$
production processes of $\PHiggs/\PHiggsps$ were generated using \texttt{PYTHIA 8.1} \cite{pythia81}.
These samples were produced in a range of masses between 90 GeV and 3.2 TeV.
This range is slightly wider than the range in which MSSM Higgs sector
benchmark computations are available, 90 GeV -- 2 TeV, and 
improves on the mass range, up to 1 TeV, studied during Run 1 in the context of BSM Higgs searches.
SM Higgs signal samples are used for the interpretation of the analysis results in 
MSSM benchmark scenarios. These samples are generated using \texttt{Powheg} \cite{powheg1,powheg2,powheg3}.

\ttbar- and single-top background samples are generated using \texttt{Powheg},
with \texttt{MadGraph5\_aMC\@NLO} \cite{amcnlo} used for the generation of di--boson background
samples and part of the W+$\gamma$ background included in the \emu channel only.
\Wjets and \Zll backgrounds are generated with the \ac{MadGraph 5} \cite{madgraph}
matrix element generator. Both samples containing a mixture
of jet multiplicities (`inclusive' samples) and samples with 1,2,3 or 4 jets (`exclusive' samples)
are generated. These exclusive samples increase the available number of
background events with higher jet multiplicities.  Part of the W+$\gamma$ background
samples are also generated with this event generator.
%note LO samples used because to get same number of effective
%events would need to generate more NLO samples
The `inclusive' and `exclusive' samples are reweighted
before they are combined so as to preserve the correct
fractions of events with each jet multiplicity.

Parton showering and hadronisation are modelled using \texttt{PYTHIA 8} for all 
samples. Minimum--bias events generated with \texttt{PYTHIA 8} are
added to all \ac{MC} samples to model additional interactions. A reweighting
is then applied to the \ac{MC} samples to make the pile--up distribution match
that observed in data.

%\section{Optimisation of object selection}
%\label{sec:mssm_baseline_opt}
%At the start of Run 2 of the \ac{LHC} an effort was first made to
%optimise the default, \textit{baseline} di-\Pgt pair selection. This provides
%a common starting point for all $\PHiggs \rightarrow \Pgt\Pgt$ analyses, on
%top of which additional selections can be made for specific analyses such
%as the MSSM \AHtotautau analysis presented in this chapter.

\section{Event selection and categorisation}
\label{sec:mssm_eventsel}
In this section an overview of the event selection,
and how it was optimised, is given. More detailed information
on how the used objects used are reconstructed, 
and a more in--depth description of the identification criteria, 
is given in chapter \ref{chap:objects}.

\subsection{Pair selection and vetos}
\label{sec:mssm_eventsel_pairs}
The basis of the event selection is the selection of \mutau, \etau,
\tautau and \emu pairs following the requirements described
in the following subsections. After applying trigger
requirements, identification criteria and kinematic cuts
more than one possible candidate pair can exist. In this
case the pair is chosen as follows:
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-\baselineskip}
\item Prefer the pair with most isolated candidate 1 (muon for \mutau and \emu channels,
electron for \etau channel, either of the $\Pgt_h$s in \tautau channel). For electrons
and muons this means the object with the smallest relative isolation value is preferred, for $\Pgt_h$s the
object with raw MVA isolation value nearest to 1.
\item If the isolation of candidate 1 is the same in both pairs, prefer the pair with highest candidate 1 \pT.
\item If the \pT of candidate 1 is the same in both pairs, prefer the pair with most isolated
candidate 2 (e for the \emu channel, the other $\Pgt_h$ for the \tautau channel, 
and the $\Pgt_h$ for \etau and \mutau channels).
\item If the isolation of candidate 2 is the same in both pairs, prefer the pair with highest candidate 2 \pT.
\end{itemize}

To prevent overlap with other channels, events are rejected
if there are muons and electrons, other than those in the selected pair,
with \pT $>10$ GeV and passing loose ID and isolation requirements.
This also reduces backgrounds from \WZ events. 
In addition to this, \Zee events are 
reduced in the \etau channel by rejecting events
where an opposite--sign pair of electrons of \pT $>15$ GeV
and passing very loose ID and isolation requirements can be formed. 
In the \mutau channel the contribution from \Zmm events
is reduced in a similar fashion. 




\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Event selection in the \mutau channel}{Event selection in the mu tau channel}}
\label{sec:mssm_eventsel_mt}
The first selection layer in the \mutau channel is a trigger
that only requires a muon at \ac{L1}. At the level of the \ac{HLT}, 
loose identification and isolation criteria are then applied to this muon.

The offline event selection proceeds to require an oppositely charged
muon and hadronically decaying tau, which are well--separated ($\Delta R > 0.5$).
The minimum \pT of the muon is required to be 23 GeV, with $|\eta| < 2.1$. %due to trigger conditions
Additional ``medium'' identification requirements are placed on the muon, in addition
to requiring the muon to be consistent with having originated from the primary vertex, such that
the impact parameters $d_{xy} < 0.045$ cm and $d_{z} < 0.2$ cm. The muon is also required
to be isolated, with a selection on its relative isolation variable calculated with a cone size of 0.4 of $< 0.15$.

The hadronic tau needs to have a \pT greater than 30 GeV, $|\eta|<2.3$,
is required to be reconstructed by the HPS algorithm and to pass the medium
working point of the MVA isolation discriminator. The hadronic tau also needs
to have originiated from the primary vertex and so the impact paramter $d_{z}$ is 
required to be less than 0.2 cm. Finally the hadronic tau is required
to satisfy the very loose working point of the anti--electron discriminator
and the tight working point of the anti--muon discriminator.

The selection on the muon's relative isolation is chosen after comparing
the performance of several isolation variables at different
relative isolation values. This was based on a simple \mutau channel
event selection as described above, with varying isolation variables.
The selection was optimised based on two figures of merit, both of
which consider \Ztautau as the signal and the other backgrounds
as background. The first figure of merit used is the number of signal events divided by the
square root of the number of background events, $S/\sqrt{B}$, after
the selection. The aim with this figure of merit is to choose
the isolation selection that maximises it. The second figure of merit
is the uncertainty interval on the best-fit value for a maximum--likelihood fit
to the \Ztautau signal strength, which should be minimised by the choice of
isolation selection.

Different isolation variables were studied over a range of values
to cut at. In addition to the $\Delta\beta$ corrected isolation variable analogous
to the one given for electrons in equation \ref{eqn:electron_reliso} with 
isolation cone sizes in $\Delta R$ of 0.3 and 0.4, a very similar
variable which does not just consider charged \ac{PF} hadrons, but
also electrons and muons in the isolation sum is considered. This
variable is also studied for both cone sizes of 0.3 and 0.4. Finally,
a relative isolation variable based solely on the \pT of tracks from the primary
vertex,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:reltrkiso}
I_{\text{trk}} = \frac{\Sigma p_{\text{T}}^{\text{tracks from PV within cone of 0.3 of the muon}}}{p_{\text{T}}^{\mu}}, \end{equation} 
is studied. The $S/\sqrt{B}$ for the different isolation variables is shown in figure \ref{fig:mssm_selection_mt_muons}a, with the
size of the error interval from the maximum--likelihood fit to the \Ztautau signal strength shown in 
\ref{fig:mssm_selection_mt_muons}b. From the fact that both figures of merit do not
vary so much with different isolation cuts and different variables we can see that this analysis
is not so sensitive to fake,nonisolated muons. The choice of isolation variable is therefore
driven mostly by simplicity and consistency with other \ac{CMS} analyses.

\label{fig:mssm_selection_mt_muons}
\end{figure}

A topological selection on the \mT~variable, 
introduced in section \ref{sec:hhh_selection_categories}, is made on 
events in the \mutau channel. This selection and the
choice of hadronic tau isolation working point interfere 
with each other and therefore they are optimised in a 2D--optimisation. 
The pre--fit expected upper limits on $\sigma\times$BR for both gg$\phi$ and bb$\phi$
production with decay into $\Pgt\Pgt$ at several mass points 
in the 90 GeV -- 3.2 TeV range are used to do this. 
Because of the use of such a wide range of signal masses, it
is not possible to choose a selection that is optimal
for every mass point. This is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:mssm_selection_mt_taumt}:
figure \ref{fig:mssm_selection_mt_taumt}a shows the upper limit on $\sigma\times$BR for
the gluon--gluon fusion production process, at a mass $m_{\phi} = 160$ GeV, with
figures \ref{fig:mssm_selection_mt_taumt}b,c and d showing this upper limit at $m_{\phi} = 900$ GeV,
$m_{\phi} = 1600$ GeV and $m_{\phi} = 2900$ GeV respectively. From these figures
we can observe that looser selections are preferred for higher masses. This can be
explained by considering the function of each of the selections. Tightening the hadronic
tau isolation working point reduces the selection of fake taus and increases the proportion
of backgrounds which contain real hadronic taus. The \mT~selection reduces
the \Wjets background. As the backgrounds are concentrated at the lower
end of the spectrum of mass--like discriminating variables, such tighter
selections are preferred where signal and backgrounds overlap. However, at higher
mass points the signal--sensitive range of the discriminating variable is 
low in backgrounds and there is more benefit to loosening the selection
to increase the signal efficiency than to keep the tighter selection
to reduce an already low background.

\label{fig:mssm_selection_mt_taumt}.
\end{figure}

Based on this information, for the analysis on the 2015 dataset the selection was optimised
for mass points around 700-800 GeV. For the analysis on the 12.9 fb$^{-1}$ collected
in the first half of 2016, the selection was further loosened by 10 GeV in \mT~cut
and one step in hadronic tau isolation working point, to obtain the medium isolation working
point selection combined with a selection on \mT$<40$ GeV.

The choice of the hadronic tau \pT selection is driven by the effect on the low mass region:
raising the \pT selection by 10 GeV from the minimum of 20 GeV does not affect the sensivity
of the analysis for high mass points, while recovering some of the loss of loosening 
tau isolation working point and \mT~cut. The reason for this is that when using \pT$>30$ GeV 
fewer background events are selected. The effect of the increased hadronic tau \pT~ cut on the 
upper limits for the gg$\phi$ production process
in figure \ref{fig:mssm_tauptcut}a, and on the bb$\phi$ production process
in figure \ref{fig:mssm_tauptcut}b. At low mass the improvement in the gg$\phi$ limits
obtained by increasing the \pT~cut is sizeable, for bb$\phi$ events the effect is much
less pronounced.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Event selection in the \etau channel}{Event selection in the e tau channel}}
\label{sec:mssm_eventsel_et}
For selection of events in the \etau channel, the first step is
a trigger that only requires an electron at \ac{L1}. At the \ac{HLT}
loose identification and isolation criteria are then required.

The offline event selection proceeds to require an oppositely charged
electron and hadronically decaying tau, which are well--separated ($\Delta R > 0.5$).
The minimum \pT of the electron is required to be 26 GeV, with $|\eta| < 2.1$. %due to trigger conditions
This electron has to be consistent with having originated from the primary vertex, which
is achieved by requiring impact parameters $d_{xy} < 0.045$ cm and $d_{z} < 0.2$ cm, and it
is required to pass additional identification criteria. A selection on the MVA identification, which
selects electrons from \Zee events with 80\% efficiency, is used. In addition the
electron needs to be isolated. The relative isolation, calculated with a cone size of 0.3, is required to be $< 0.1$.

The hadronic tau is required to have a \pT greater than 30 GeV, $|\eta|<2.3$,
and is required to be reconstructed by the HPS algorithm and to pass the medium
working point of the MVA isolation discriminator. It also needs
to have originiated from the primary vertex and so the impact paramter $d_{z}$ is 
required to be less than 0.2 cm. Finally, the hadronic tau should
pass the tight working point of the anti--electron discriminator
and the loose working point of the anti--muon discriminator.

Just like for muons, it was found that the analysis is not highly sensitive
to the choice of electron isolation variable and selection, yet an effort
is made not to use a suboptimal selection.
A topological selection on the \mT~ variable is also made in this channel to reject \Wjets events. 
The used value of \mT $< 50$ is obtained by performing a 2D optimisation where the \mT~ selection
and hadronic tau isolation working point are varied at the same time. The same considerations as
for the \mutau channel apply. The choice of the hadronic tau \pT~ selection to 30 GeV is
chosen to recover some of the sensitivity lost at low mass by using looser \mT~ and hadronic
tau isolation selections. This is illustrated in figure \ref{fig:mssm_tauptcut_et}.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Event selection in the \tautau channel}{Event selection in the tau tau channel}}
\label{sec:mssm_eventsel_tt}
Selection of events in the \tautau channel starts with a trigger
that requires two hadronic taus at \ac{L1}. At the level of the \ac{HLT}, loose identification
and isolation criteria are applied to these hadronic taus.

The offline event selection continues by requiring both hadronic taus to be oppositely charged, separated
by $\Delta R > 0.5$, have pT~ of at least 40 GeV and $|\eta|<2.1$. Both taus need
to pass decay mode finding and have originated from the primary vertex, with the impact parameter $d_{z} < 0.2$ cm. 
Both taus need to pass the tight working point of the isolation discriminator, the very loose 
working point of the anti--electron discriminator and the loose working point of the anti--muon discriminator. 
The tight working point of the isolation discriminator is chosen to optimise the sensitivity
of this channel for higher masses. INSERT PLOT

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{Event selection in the \emu channel}{Event selection in the e mu channel}}
\label{sec:mssm_eventsel_em}
Events in the \emu channel are first selected by two triggers
that both require an electron and muon at \ac{L1} and apply loose ID and
isolation requirements to these objects at \ac{HLT}. The \pT requirements on
the electron and muon are different in the two triggers, thus using the combination of the two
improves the analysis performance.

The offline requirements to the \emu pair are that the electron 
and muon are oppositely charged, separated by $\Delta R >$ 0.3. The 
electron should have a minimum \pT~ of 13 GeV and have $|\eta|< 2.5$. As
in the \etau channel the electron's impact parameters have to 
satisfy $d_{xy} < 0.045$ cm and $d_{z}<0.2$ cm. A selection is
made on the electron identification MVA, using a working point that 
is 80\% efficient for electrons in \Zee decays. The electron
also needs to be isolated, with the relative isolation calculated
with a cone size of 0.3 being less than $<0.15$.

The muons need to have a \pT~of at least 10 GeV, $|\eta|<2.4$ and 
their impact parameters need to be $d_{xy}<0.045$ cm and $d_{z}<0.2$ cm.
In addition to the kinematic requirements the muon must
pass the medium identification criteria and be isolated with the relative
isolation, calculated with a cone size of 0.4, required to be less than 0.15.

Because a combination of triggers is used, the object firing
the higher \pT~ trigger leg needs to have a transverse momentum
of at least 24 GeV on top of the requirements already discussed.
In addition, a topological selection is made on the $D_{\zeta}$ variable \cite{cdf-dzeta},
\begin{align}\label{eqn:mssm_em_dzeta}
D_{\zeta} = P_{\zeta} - 1.85 P_{\zeta}^{\text{vis}}, \notag \\
\text{where } P_{\zeta} = (\vec{p}_{\text{T},1}^{\text{vis}} + \vec{p}_{\text{T},2}^{\text{vis}} + E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}})\frac{\vec{\zeta}}{|\vec{\zeta}|}, \notag \\
\text{and } P_{\zeta}^{\text{vis}} = (\vec{p}_{\text{T},1}^{\text{vis}}+\vec{p}_{\text{T},2}^{\text{vis}})\frac{\vec{\zeta}}{|\vec{\zeta}|}.
\end{align}

Thus $D_{\zeta}$ is the difference of the projection of the visible tau decay products plus missing energy \pT+\MET,
and simply the visible tau decay product \pT on the axis $\vec{\zeta}$. This is the axis that bisects 
the directions $\vec{p}_{\text{T,1}}^{\text{vis}}$ and $\vec{p}_{\text{T,2}}^{\text{vis}}$
of the visible decay products in the transverse plane. This selection is illustrated in figure
\ref{fig:mssm_dzeta}a, with figure \ref{fig:mssm_dzeta}b showing the $D_{\zeta}$ distribution
for \emu events. The used cut value, $D_{\zeta} > -20$ GeV rejects $\ttbar$, \Wjets and diboson
events. 
%The momentum of the neutrinos should not be in the opposite direction of the sum of the visible decay products
%as the neutrinos and visible tau decay products travel at small angles from the original tau.

\subsection{Categorisation}
\label{sec:mssm_eventsel_categories}
As the analysis targets both the gluon--gluon fusion
and the b--associated production modes of MSSM Higgs
bosons, two exclusive categories are defined based on the 
number of b--tagged jets, where a jet is considered b--tagged
if it passes the medium working point of the \ac{CSV}v2 discriminator. 
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-\baselineskip}
\item \textbf{No b-tag}: 0 b--tagged jets. This category targets the gg$\phi$ production mode but is also sensitive to some of the bb$\phi$ signal
\item \textbf{b-tag}: At least 1 b--tagged jet and at most 1 
jet with \pT$>30$ GeV. Due to the different phase space considered for
b--tagging than for normal jet reconstruction this requirement does not necessarily
mean there will be only one b--tagged jet in the event. The requirement reduces the sizeable \ttbar
background
\end{itemize}

Figure \ref{fig:mssm_cats_mt}a shows the number of jets 
in the \mutau channel, with \ref{fig:mssm_cats_mt}b showing
the number of b--tagged jets in that channel. The gluon--gluon fusion
signal and bb associated signal are overlaid on these distributions, normalised
to 100 times their cross--section times branching ratio at \mA=1 TeV and 
\tanb=50 in the $m_{\text{h}}^{\text{mod+}}$ scenario. From the distribution of the
gluon--gluon fusion signal in figure \ref{fig:mssm_cats_mt}b we can 
see that the vast majority of these signal events do not have any b-tagged jets, which
motivates the choice of the no b-tag category to target this signal. From
the bb associated signal in the same figure we also see that the majority of bb associated
signal events do not have any b-tagged jets either: either the b-jets in these events 
are too soft, or they do not pass the b-tagging requirements. This means the no b-tag 
category is also sensitive to some of the bb$\phi$ signal. The other observation we 
can make from the bb$\phi$ signal in figure \ref{fig:mssm_cats_mt}b is that there is not
such a large proportion of events with more than 1 b-tagged jet. From figure \ref{fig:mssm_cats_mt}a
we see that the \ttbar background starts to become more sizeable for events with more than
one jet. The definition of the b-tag category is therefore chosen with the inclusion
of the jet veto, such that the region where the \ttbar background becomes larger is excluded, 
while retaining a large proportion of the bb$\phi$ signal.

scenario. We can see how the signal--sensitive bins motivate the choice of categories.}

\section{\ac{MC} to data correction factors}
\label{sec:mssm_mccorrs}
Because \ac{MC} samples are used for the signal predication, and 
to estimate some of the backgrounds, it is important to correct for possible 
mis-modelling with respect to the data. Dedicated control regions in
data are used to derive the \ac{MC} to data correction factors
that are applied to the \ac{MC} samples.
\subsubsection*{Tracking efficiency}
A discrepancy between the track reconstruction efficiency
in data and \ac{MC} for electrons and muons was found. $\eta$--dependent
scale factors are applied to mitigate the issue \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037}.
\subsubsection*{Electron, muon and tau ID and isolation}
Identification and isolation efficiencies in data and \ac{MC} are measured
for electrons, muons and hadronic taus. A tag--and--probe
method using \Zeenog (\Zmmnog) events is used to measure
the efficiencies for electrons (muons). The hadronic tau identification
and isolation efficiency is measured using a tag--and--probe method
making use of $Z\rightarrow\Pgt\Pgt\rightarrow\Pgm\Pgt_{h}$ events.
The measured efficiencies are used to construct scale factors to be
applied to the \ac{MC} samples as $SF = \frac{\epsilon_{\text{Data}}}{\epsilon_{\text{MC}}}$.
\subsubsection*{Trigger efficiency}
The electron, muon and hadronic tau trigger efficiencies are also measured
using tag--and--probe methods with the types of events as described for the identification
and isolation efficiencies. Because no trigger simulation is applied to
the \ac{MC} samples, the efficiency $\epsilon_{\text{Data}}$ is simply applied
to the \ac{MC} events. Because two electron/muon cross--triggers are 
used to select events in the \emu channel, the efficiencies of the different
cross trigger legs need to be combined. With one of the cross triggers having a
\pT~cut of 23 GeV on the muon leg and 12 GeV on the electron leg, and the
other having a minimum \pT~ of 23 GeV on the electron leg and 8 GeV on the muon
leg, the combined efficiency of the two triggers becomes:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mssm_em_trigeff}
\begin{split}
\epsilon_{\text{data}}  = \epsilon_{\text{data}}(\text{Mu23})\cdot\epsilon_{\text{data}}(\text{Ele12}) + \epsilon_{\text{data}}(\text{Mu8})\cdot\epsilon_{\text{data}}(\text{Ele23})~\\ - \epsilon_{\text{data}}(\text{Mu23})\cdot\epsilon_{\text{data}}(\text{Ele23}).
\end{split}
\end{equation}
\subsubsection*{$\Pe\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$ fake rate and $\Pgm\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$ fake rate}
The $\Pe\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$ and $\Pgm\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$ fake rates
after applying the anti--electron and anti--muon discriminators are measured
using a tag--and--probe method with \Zeenog and \Zmmnog events. A scale
factor, to be applied to \ac{MC} events where the tau is faked by an electron or muon,
is derived as the ratio between the fake rate in data and the fake rate in \ac{MC} events.
\subsubsection*{\MET recoil corrections}
Differences in \MET~ resolution and response between data and \ac{MC} 
are accounted for by the application of recoil corrections
to signal, \Wjets and \Ztautau events. These corrections
are detailed in section \ref{sec:objects_met_recoilcorr}.
\subsubsection*{B-tag scale factors}
To correct for the difference in b--tagging efficiency
and light jet mis--tagging rates between data and \ac{MC}
\pT~ and $\eta$ dependent scale factors are derived as 
described in reference \cite{cms-btag-run2}. They 
are applied using the promote--demote method
as outlined in equation \ref{eqn:promotedemote}.
\subsubsection*{Top-quark \pT reweighting}
A reweighting which was derived during \ac{LHC} Run-1
to better match the top quark \pT~distribution in \ac{MC}
to that observed in data is applied to \ttbar events. Despite
the fact that the correction was derived during Run-1, it still
improves the data/\ac{MC} agreement in a \ttbar enriched
control region, as shown in figure \ref{fig:mssm_corrs_toppt}.
\subsubsection*{Drell-Yan shape reweighting}
As the \ac{MC} samples used for the \Ztautau estimate
do not model the data well for events with high di-lepton
mass and high Z \pT~, a reweighting is applied to correct for this.
These weights are derived in bins of $\PZ/Pphoton*$ mass and \pT~
using \Zmm events in data, in such a way that they do not
change the overall Drell-Yan normalisation. The weights
are then applied to the \Ztautau and \Zellell background processes.

\section{Discriminating variable}
\label{sec:mssm_discrvar}
The discriminating variable used for signal extraction is the total transverse mass,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mttot}
m_{\text{T}}^{\text{tot}} = \sqrt{(m_{\text{T}}(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}},\tau_1^{\text{vis}}))^2+
(m_{\text{T}}(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}},\tau_2^{\text{vis}}))^2 + (m_{\text{T}}(\Pgt_1^{\text{vis}},\Pgt_2^{\text{vis}}))^2}.
\end{equation}

$m_{\text{T}}(1,2)$ is defined as,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mttot_12}
m_{\text{T}}(1,2) = \sqrt{2p_{\text{T},1}p_{\text{T},2}(1-\cos{(\Delta\phi(1,2))})}.
\end{equation}

This means that $m_{\text{T}}(E_{\text{T}}^{\text{miss}},\Pgt_1^{\text{vis}})$ is equivalent
to the \mT~ defined for the \etau and \mutau channels in equation \ref{eqn:hhh_selection_mt}.
The \mTtot~ variable provides good separation between signal and QCD multi--jet events
in the \etau, \mutau and \tautau channels, and between
signal and \ttbar events in the \emu channel.

\section{Background estimation}
\label{sec:mssm_bkgs}
The methods used for background estimation will be described in this
section. As the \mutau and \etau channels use very similar
background methods, they are described in the same subsection.

\subsection{Generator matching}
\label{sec:mssm_bkgs_genmatch}
For backgrounds estimated from \ac{MC} there are often 
different sub--processes playing a role that should be
treated separately by the fit. Taking the \mutau 
channel as an example, a sample of Drell--Yan events
will contain \Ztautau events, where one of the taus decays
hadronically and the other tau decays to a muon, but also
\Zmm events where one of the muons fakes a tau, or with an 
additional jet in the event faking a hadronic tau and one of the
muons not being properly reconstructed. Similarly, \ttbar background
events can be split into those with genuine taus, and those
where a jet mimics a hadronic tau.

Dividing events from the same production
process into sub--samples
based on generator level information allows
for a more correct treatment of systematic uncertainties. 

To determine the generator-level particle
that a reconstructed electron, muon, or hadronic tau
originates from, reconstructed objects are matched
to a set of generator level objects within a cone of $\Delta R = 0.2$.
Five categories of generator-level object are considered for matching:
prompt electrons and muons,
that is electrons and muons not originating from a decay; electrons and muons
from tau decays; and generator-level hadronic taus. These generator-level
hadronic taus are rebuilt by summing the four--momenta
of the visible decay products of the generator-level tau.

All of these particles are looked for in a cone of $\Delta R = 0.2$ around
the reconstructed object, and if there are multiple generator-level
particles within this cone the one nearest the reconstructed particle
is chosen as the object this particle is matched to. If there are no 
generator-level particles in the cone at all it is said to 
have originated from pile--up or a jet at generator level.

The generator--level object type matched to a 
reconstructed particle is used to perform the splitting
of background samples, and is indicated where this is used.


\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\Ztautau}{Z to tau tau}}
\label{sec:mssm_bkgs_ztt}
For all channels, both shape and normalisation of the \Ztautau background 
is estimated from the Drell-Yan
\ac{MC} samples described in section \ref{sec:mssm_datasets}.
For the \mutau and \etau channels, events from these samples 
in which the reconstructed hadronic tau is matched to 
a generator-level hadronic tau are considered part of the \Ztautau
background. In the \tautau channel both reconstructed
hadronic taus are required to be matched to a generator-level hadronic tau, and
in the \emu channel the \Ztautau component of the Drell-Yan background 
is taken as those events where the reconstructed electron is not matched to
a prompt electron at generator level and the reconstructed
muon is not matched to a prompt muon. 
Events in the Drell-Yan samples selected in the event selection
but not satisfying the generator matching requirements are considered
as the, much smaller, \Zll background.

To correct and constrain the \Ztautau normalisation in the
b-tag and no b-tag categories of all channels, \Zmm control
regions are simultaneously fitted. More detail is given in 
section \ref{sec:mssm_sigext_ctrl}.

\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\Wjets and QCD in the \etau and \mutau channels}{W+jets and QCD in the e tau and mu tau channels}}
\label{sec:mssm_bkgs_mtet_wjetsqcd}
A data--driven approach is used for the estimation of
both the \Wjets and QCD backgrounds in the \etau and \mutau channels. 
The estimates of the normalisations of the two backgrounds are tied
together due to the presence of some QCD contamination in the \Wjets--dominated
control region. The shape of the \Wjets background is taken
from the \ac{MC} samples, with the QCD shape taken from same--sign
data with other backgrounds subtracted.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\Wjets normalisation}{W+jets normalisation}}
\label{sec:mssm_bkgs_mtet_wjetsnorm}
The \Wjets normalisation is derived using a high-\mT~ control region, where
selected events are required to satisfy \mT$>70$ GeV. In the no b-tag
category the \Wjets
contribution in this region is enhanced, however there is still
some contribution from QCD events in this region. This is visible in 
figure \ref{fig:mssm_bkgs_wjets_mutau_mt} which shows the \mT~ distribution in the
\mutau channel, indicating the signal region and the high-\mT~ control region. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./MSSM/Figures/CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037_Figure_002.pdf}
\end{center}
\caption{Distribution of the transverse mass \mT~ in the \mutau channel, indicating
the signal region and the high \mT~ control region \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037}.}
\label{fig:mssm_bkgs_wjets_mutau_mt}
\end{figure}

Because of this contribution from QCD events in the high \mT~ region we
have, for \mT$>70$ GeV:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:wjets_ss_norm}
\begin{split}
N_{\text{data}}^{SS, \text{high } m_{\text{T}}} - N_{\text{other}}^{SS,
\text{high } m_{\text{T}}} & =
N_{\text{QCD}}^{SS, \text{high } m_{\text{T}}} + N_{W}^{SS, \text{high } m_{\text{T}}} ~\\
N_{\text{data}}^{OS, \text{high } m_{\text{T}}} - N_{\text{other}}^{OS,
\text{high } m_{\text{T}}} & = N_{\text{QCD}}^{OS, \text{high } m_{\text{T}}} +
N_{W}^{OS, \text{high } m_{\text{T}}} \\
& = R_{\text{QCD}}^{OS/SS}\cdot N_{\text{QCD}}^{SS, \text{high } m_{\text{T}}} +
R_{W}^{OS/SS} \cdot N_{W}^{SS, \text{high } m_{\text{T}}} ~\\
\Rightarrow N_{W}^{SS, \text{high } m_{\text{T}}}  &= \frac{N_{\text{data}}^{OS,
\text{high } m_{\text{T}}}  - N_{\text{other}}^{OS, \text{high } m_{\text{T}}}  -
R_{\text{QCD}}^{OS/SS}\cdot(N_{\text{data}}^{SS, \text{high } m_{\text{T}}}  -
N_{\text{other}}^{SS, \text{high } m_{\text{T}}} )}{R_{W}^{OS/SS} -
R_{\text{QCD}}^{OS/SS}} ,
\end{split}
\end{equation}

where $R_{W}^{OS/SS}$ is the ratio between opposite-sign and same-sign \Wjets events
and $R_{QCD}^{OS/SS}$ the ratio between opposite-sign and same-sign QCD events. Using 
equations \ref{eqn:wjets_ss_norm}, the number of \Wjets events in the
opposite-sign, high \mT~region is given by $R_{W}^{OS/SS}\cdot N_{W}^{SS,\text{high} m_{T}}$. 
This is extrapolated to the number of \Wjets events in the signal region at low \mT~ as:

\begin{equation}\label{eqn:wjets_os_norm}
N_{W}^{OS,\text{low} m_{T}} = \frac{N_{W,MC}^{OS,\text{low} m_{T}}}{N_{W,MC}^{OS,\text{high} m_{T}}}\cdot R_{W}^{OS/SS} \cdot N_W^{SS,\text{high }m_{T}},
\end{equation}

which is the estimate of the number of \Wjets events in the opposite-sign, high \mT, region
multiplied by the ratio of the number of \ac{MC} events in the opposite-sign, low \mT~ region to the number of \ac{MC} events in the opposite-sign, high \mT~region. This means that
the \ac{MC} samples are used to derive a high \mT-to-low \mT extrapolation factor.

The use of the method presented relies on knowledge of $R_{W}^{OS/SS}$,
$R_{QCD}^{OS/SS}$, and on these two ratios not being too similar to each other. 
The ratio $R_{QCD}^{OS/SS}$ is measured in an anti--isolated
control region in data; this is described in section \ref{sec:mssm_bkgs_etmt_qcdosss}. $R_{W}^{OS/SS}$ is 
taken from the \Wjets \ac{MC} samples, and is found to be between 4 and 5, while $R_{QCD}^{OS/SS}$
is close to 1.

The method described so far works well in the no b-tag categories, but in the b-tag category
the \ttbar background dominates. For this reason the estimate of the number
of \Wjets events in this category is made with a relaxed category selection where the b-tagging
requirement itself is removed, but the jet requirements still stand. Events with at least one 
jet with \pT$>20$ GeV and with $|\eta|<2.4$, but at most one jet with \pT$>30$ GeV and $|\eta|<4.7$, are therefore selected. The final \Wjets estimate in the b-tag category signal
region is determined by the estimate given by the number of \Wjets events
estimated in the 1-jet selection, multiplied by an extrapolation factor 
$\frac{N_{W,MC}^{OS,\text{low } m_{T},\text{b-tag category}}}{N_{W,MC}^{OS,\text{low }m_{\text{T}},\text{1-jet selection}}}$ ADD FIGURES

\subsubsection{QCD OS/SS ratio}
\label{sec:mssm_bkgs_etmt_qcdosss}
The ratio of opposite--sign to same--sign QCD events, $R_{QCD}^{OS/SS}$ is measured
in two anti-isolated sidebands by performing a fit to the distribution of the
visible mass of the di-tau pair in 
opposite-sign events. The QCD template, which is taken from same--sign events 
assuming $R_{QCD}^{OS/SS} = 1$ is treated as the signal, and a binned maximum
likelihood fit to the QCD signal strength is performed while allowing the other
backgrounds to float within reasonable normalisation uncertainties. The
resulting best fit value of the signal strengh parameter is taken as $R_{QCD}^{OS/SS}$.
Of the two sidebands used, one is nearer the signal region ($0.15<I_{\text{rel}}^{\mu}<0.25$ and $0.1<I_{\text{rel}}^{e}<0.2$)
and one further away ($0.25<I_{\text{rel}}^{\mu}<0.5$ and $0.2<I_{\text{rel}}^{e}<0.5$). The results of the fits,
performed before the categorisation of events into the b-tag and no b-tag categories, are shown in figures \ref{fig:mssm_qcdosss_mtnear}--\ref{fig:mssm_qcdosss_far}
for the \mutau channel and in figures \ref{fig:mssm_qcdosss_etnear}--\ref{fig:mssm_qcdosss_etfar} for the \etau channel.
$R_{QCD}^{OS/SS}$ is found to be consistent within 10\% (1\%) in the \etau (\mutau) channel between the two sidebands.
Adding this in quadrature to the uncertainty on the fit in the sidebands nearest the signal region we find
an overall uncertainty of 12\% in the \etau channel and 4\% in the \mutau channel.
When performing the same fits in the no b-tag and b-tag categories to determine differences between
this pre-categorisation opposite--sign to same--sign ratio, and the ratio as measured in categories it is found that 
the fit is not stable in the b-tag category due to the number of events in this region being too small.
The uncertainty on the ratio is increased for the b-tag category to cover the differences.
The uncertainties are already large enough to cover differences between the pre-categorisation $R_{QCD}^{OS/SS}$ and the
fits as performed in the no b-tag category. So $R_{QCD}^{OS/SS}$ in the \mutau channel is taken to be
1.18 in both the b-tag and the no b-tag category, with a 60\% uncertainty in the b-tag category and a 4\% uncertainty in the no b-tag category.
In the \etau channel $R_{QCD}^{OS/SS}$ is taken to be 1.02 with a 60\% uncertainty in the b-tag category and a 12\% uncertainty
in the no b-tag category.

\end{figure}




\subsubsection{QCD normalisation}
\label{sec:mssm_bkgs_etmt_qcdnorm}
The QCD normalisation is estimated by inverting the opposite-sign requirement
of the di-tau pair in the signal region. The yield is taken from the same--sign
region with otherwise identical cuts to the opposite--sign region. The contributions
from other backgrounds in this region are subtracted to give an estimate of the number
of QCD events in the same--sign region. For all backgrounds apart from \Wjets the
yields to subtract are estimated using \ac{MC} samples. The number of \Wjets events
expected in this region is given by
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:wjets_qcdsub}
N_{W,SS SR} = \frac{N_{MC,SS SR}}{N_{MC,SS high mT}}N_{W,SS high mT}
\end{equation}

Because opposite--sign and same--sign QCD events do not
necessarily appear in equal amounts the number of QCD
events obtained by subtracting other backgrounds from the
observed number of events in the same--sign region is multiplied
by $R_{QCD}^{OS/SS}$ as derived in section \ref{sec:mssm_bkgs_etmt_qcdosss} 
to obtain an estimate of the number of QCD events in the signal region.

\subsubsection{Control regions in the fit}
\label{sec:mssm_bkgs_etmt_ctrl}
Several control regions in data are used for the estimation
of the QCD and \Wjets backgrounds: the same--sign and 
opposite--sign high \mT~ regions, as well as the same--sign
low \mT~region. This leads to three control regions used 
in each category of both the \mutau and \etau channels to determine
the initial estimate of the background normalisations.
These control regions are included in a simultaneous fit
with the signal regions to obtain the final results.


\subsection{QCD}
\label{sec:mssm_bkgs_qcd}
This section describes the QCD background
estimation in the \tautau and \emu channels.

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\tautau channel}{tau tau channel}}
\label{sec:mssm_bkgs_qcd_tt}
In the \tautau channel the QCD background is by far the 
dominant background. The normalisation and shape 
of this background are estimated from a sideband with loosened 
isolation requirements with respect to the signal region. 
In the no b-tag category the sideband used is determined
by having the tau with highest \pT~ pass the tight working
point of the tau ID discriminator, as in the nominal selection.
The other hadronic tau in the pair does not pass the tight working point,
but does pass the medium working point. This sideband is 
chosen as it is as close to the signal region as possible, and 
this should minimise biases in the shape of the total transverse mass
distribution. Other backgrounds
in this sideband are subtracted from the observation to give
the QCD estimate. Differences in normalisation due to
the use of a loosened sideband are corrected for by loose-to-tight isolation
scale factor. This correction factor is measured as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:tautau_qcd}
R_{QCD}^{\text{loose}\rightarrow\text{tight}} = \frac{N_{obs}^{SS,\text{nominal isolation}}-N_{\text{other bkgs}}^{SS,\text{loosened isolation}}}{N_{obs}^{SS,\text{loosened isolation}}-N_{\text{other bkgs}}^{SS,\text{loosened isolation}}}.
\end{equation}

So this takes the ratio between the observed data with other
backgrounds subtracted in the region equivalent to the signal region, but with the
charge requirement of the pair inverted, and the region equivalent to the sideband
with loosened isolation but with the charge requirement on the pair inverted.

An analogous method is used for this estimate in the 
b-tag category, however, the sideband as used for the 
no b-tag category does not contain enough events to 
provide a background estimate. Therefore a sideband where
the highest \pT~tau passes the tight working point of the
tau ID discriminator, and the other tau passes the loose working
point of the discriminator, but not the tight working point, is used.
This sideband is slightly further away from the signal region than the
'tight--medium' sideband INSERT FIGURE. The bias from using this looser
sideband has been assessed and has a less than 1$\sigma$ effect.
FIXME THIS ISN'T VERY USEFUL INFO!

\subsubsection{\texorpdfstring{\emu channel}{e mu channel}}
\label{sec:mssm_bkgs_qcd_em}
In the \emu channel the QCD multijet background
is estimated by inverting the charge requirement
of the pair, considering the same--sign region
with otherwise identical cuts to the signal region.
Other backgrounds present in this region are subtracted.
As for the \etau and \mutau channels, the number of
QCD events with opposite--sign \emu pairs is not
necessarily equal to the number of QCD events
with same--sign \emu pairs and therefore the ratio
of opposite--sign to same--sign pairs is measured by inverting
the isolation requirements on the electron or muon. Both
leptons need to satisfy $I_{\text{rel}} < 0.4$ and at 
least one of them needs to fail the nominal isolation requirement.
The opposite--sign to same--sign ratio is parameterised in terms
of lepton kinematics and the separation in $\Delta R$ between the
two leptons. These ratios are then applied to the same--sign region
QCD estimate to give a QCD estimate in the signal region. 
Because the opposite--sign to same--sign ratios are measured
before applying the categorisation, and \ac{MC} studies suggest
that the opposite--sign to same--sign ratio is different in the b-tag
category than in the no b-tag category, an extra scale factor of 
1.45/2.20 is applied to the QCD estimate in this category.


\subsection{\texorpdfstring{\ttbar}{ttbar}}
\label{sec:mssm_bkgs_tt}
The \ttbar shape and normalisation are estimated from \ac{MC} 
samples and are checked against data in a control
region with a \ttbar purity of 91\%. This control region
is defined as $D_{\zeta} < -20$ GeV and \MET $>80$ GeV in 
the \emu channel, and it is shown in \ref{fig:mssm_corrs_toppt}.
Because the 6\%
\ttbar normalisation uncertainty covers the observed
discrepancy between data and \ac{MC}, no scale factor is applied.
In the \mutau, \etau and \tautau channels
the \ttbar contribution is split into
two components, one with real taus and 
one without. The component with real taus is composed
of \ttbar events in which the hadronic tau is matched
to a generator level tau. In the fully hadronic channel
both taus need to be generator matched to a hadronically
decaying tau.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{./MSSM/Figures/mt_tot_ttcontrol_em_2016.png}
\end{center}
\caption{\mTtot~ distribution in the \ttbar enriched control region.
The uncertainty band includes the statistical uncertainty as well as a 6\% \ttbar cross--section uncertainty.}
\label{fig:mssm_corrs_toppt}
\end{figure}


\subsection{Di--boson plus single--top}
\label{sec:mssm_bkgs_other}
For all channels the di--boson plus 
single--top background is small.
Both normalisation and shape are estimated from \ac{MC}
samples. For the \etau, \mutau and \tautau channels
this background contribution is split into a component
where the hadronically decaying tau originates from a real
tau, and one where it does not. This is done in a similar
way as for the \ttbar background
In the \tautau and \emu channels the \Wjets background
is less important than in the \etau and \mutau channels, and both
its shape and normalisation are estimated from the
\ac{MC} samples.


\section{Systematic uncertainties}
\label{sec:mssm_uncs}
Just like for the analysis presented in chapter \ref{chap:hhh}
two types of systematic uncertainty are considered. Normalisation
uncertainties only affect the yield of a process while shape
uncertainties affect both the process normalisation, as well as the shape
of the \mTtot~ distribution. The uncertainties are taken into account 
in the final result as described in section \ref{sec:hhh_results_extraction}.

\subsection{Normalisation uncertainties}
\label{sec:mssm_uncs_norm}
\subsubsection*{Luminosity uncertainty}
The uncertainty on the luminosity measurement amounts to 6.2\% for
data collected during 2016 \cite{cms-pas-lum-15-001}, and it is
applied to all processes for which the normalisation is estimated 
using \ac{MC} samples.
\subsubsection*{Identification, isolation and trigger efficiencies}
The uncertainty on electron and muon identification, isolation, and
trigger efficiency amounts to 2\% \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037}. For hadronic taus the identification and
isolation uncertainty amounts to 6\% in the \etau and \mutau channels
and 12\% in the \tautau channel, with an additional 7\% uncertainty
on the tau trigger efficiency added in quadrature for that channel \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037}. This
uncertainty is split between a part that is correlated between the channels, 
a 5\% (10\%) uncertainty in the \etau and \mutau (\tautau) channels. The uncorrelated 
part amounts to 3\% (9.2\%) for the \etau and \mutau (\tautau) channels.
The uncertainties on lepton/hadronic tau identificiation, isolation and 
trigger efficiency are applied to all processes for which the normalisation
is estimated using \ac{MC} samples.
\subsubsection*{jet$\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$ fake rate}
The uncertainty on the jet$\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$ fake rate
is 20\% \cite{cms-tau-2015}. This uncertainty is applied
to those backgrounds where the normalisation is estimated from \ac{MC} and
where the hadronic taus are mimicked by jets, that is the \Zellell background
with a jet faking a hadronic tau, the \Wjets background in the fully hadronic
channel, and the \ttbar background with a jet faking a hadronic tau. 
\subsubsection*{$\Pe\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$ and $\Pgm\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$ fake rate}
The $\Pe\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$ fake rate uncertainty ranges from 10-30\%,
depending on the anti-electron discriminator used \cite{cms-tau-2015}. This uncertainty is 
applied to the \Zellell background with the hadronic tau faked by an electron.
The $\Pgm\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$ fake rate uncertainty ranges from 20-30\%, depending
on the anti-muon discriminator used\cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037}. This uncertainty is applied to the \Zellell
background with the hadronic tau faked by a muon.
\subsubsection*{Jet energy scale uncertainty}
The uncertainties on the jet-energy corrections are applied
by shifting the jet energy up and down by the \pT~ and $\eta$ dependendent
uncertainty, and evaluating the the change in process normalisation in
each category. Where the change in normalisation is non-negligible the
uncertainty is applied. It ranges from 1--10\% depending on process and category.
\subsubsection*{B-tag scale factors}
Uncertainties on the b-tagging efficiency and light jet mis-tagging
rates are given as a function of jet \pT~ and $\eta$ for the 
medium working point of the \ac{CSV}v2 discriminator \cite{cms-btag-run2}.
The b-tagging scale factors are are varied within these uncertainties
and the overall change in normalisation for each process in each category is
evaluated. If the change in normalisation is non-negligible this
uncertainty is applied. The uncertainty varies from 1--5\%.
\subsubsection*{\MET resolution and response}
Uncertainties on \MET resolution and response are estimated
by varying the recoil correction paramters within their
uncertainty and evaluating the effect on process
normalisations. The uncertainty amounts to around 2\%
\subsubsection*{Background normalisation}
\begin{itemize}
\setlength{\itemsep}{-\baselineskip}
\item \Ztautau: As the \Zmm control region is included in the simultaneous
fit with the signal region to correct the \Ztautau normalisation
the Drell-Yan cross section is not applied as an uncertainty. A 3\% (5\%)
extrapolation uncertainty from \Zmm $\rightarrow$ \Ztautau is applied in 
the no b-tag (b-tag) category \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037}.
\item \Zellell: The uncertainty on the Drell-Yan cross-section
amounts to 4\% \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037}.
\item \ttbar: The uncertainty on the \ttbar cross-section amounts
to 6\% \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037}.
\item di-boson and single-top: The uncertainty on the di-boson and
single-top production cross-sections amounts to 5\% \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037}.
\item \Wjets: In the \mutau and \etau channels the statistical uncertainties
on the observed data and subtracted backgrounds are taken into account by
the inclusion of these control regions in the fit. The statistical and 
uncertainties on $R_{W}^{\text{OS/SS}}$ amounts to 2\% in the no b-tag
category in both the \etau and \mutau channels, and 11\% (14\%) in the b-tag
category of the \mutau (\etau) channel. The systematic unsertainty on
this ratio amounts to 8\% (10\%) in the no b-tag (b-tag) category of both channels.
The statistical uncertainty on the low \mT/high \mT ratio is 2\% in the no b-tag
category of both channels and 14\% (17\%) in the b-tag category of the \mutau (\etau) channel.
The systematic uncertainty on this ratio amounts to 20\%. As the \Wjets background
in the \tautau and \emu channels is estimated from \ac{MC} a 4\% theoretical
normalisation uncertainty is applied.
\item QCD: In the \emu channel the uncertainty on the QCD estimate
is taken as the uncertainty on the measured opposite--sign to same--sign
ratio, which is 23\% in the no b-tag category and 34 \% in the b-tag category. In the
\tautau channel the statistical uncertainty on the QCD estimate is derived from
the uncertainties on the observations and subtracted backgrounds in the
sidebands used to derive the estimate. This uncertainty amounts to 3\% in the no b-tag
category and 20\% in the b-tag category. An additional systematic uncertainty on the
extrapolation factor from the anti-isolated sideband into the signal region is found
to be 12\% in the no b-tag category and 14 \% in the b-tag category. For the \etau and
\mutau channels the statistical
uncertainties on the observation and subtracted \ac{MC} backgrounds in the control
region used to derive the QCD estimate from is accounted for by the inclusion of control
regions in the fit. The uncertainty on the opposite--sign to same--sign ratio, based on
the studies described in section QCD OSSS is found to be 4\% (60\%) in the 
no b-tag (b-tag) category of the \mutau channel, and 12\% (60\%) in the no b-tag (b-tag) category
of the \etau channel. 
\end{itemize}
\subsubsection*{Signal theory uncertainties}
For interpretations of the results in MSSM benchmark scenarios, theory
uncertainties on the SM and MSSM Higgs cross section predictions are included. 
The uncertainties for the SM signal processes are described in more detail in reference \cite{YR4}.
Uncertainties due to different renormalisation scales. 
amount to 3.9\% for gluon fusion production,
0.4\% for vector boson fusion, 2.8\% for ZH and 0.5\% for WH. The uncertainties
due to different choice of pdf and $\alpha_s$ amount to 3.2\% for gluon fusion, 2.1\% for vector boson fusion,
1.6\% for ZH and 1.9\% for WH.
For the MSSM Higgs cross sections used in the models, the uncertainties
due to different choices of factorisation and renormalisation scale
are computed, separately for each \mA-\tanb~ point, following the description in refs\cite{pdf-lhc,alphas-uncs}.

\subsection{Shape uncertainties}
\label{sec:mssm_uncs_shape}
\subsubsection*{$\Pgt_{h}$ energy scale}
The energy of hadronic taus is varied up and down by 3\% \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037}. As the 
shape of the total transverse mass distribution depends on the energy of the $\Pgt_{h}$
it is applied as a shape uncertainty. It is applied to the signal samples and to
backgrounds containing real hadronic taus in the \etau, \mutau, and \tautau channels:
\Ztautau, and the components of the \ttbar and single-top+di-boson background with real 
hadronic taus.
\subsubsection*{Electron energy scale}
The energy of electrons is varied by 1\% in the barrel and by 2.5\% in the endcaps \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037}. This affects
the shape of the total transverse mass distribution, and this uncertainty is applied to the
signals and to the \Ztautau background.
\subsubsection*{High-\pT~ $\Pgt_{h}$ ID efficiency}
An additional $\Pgt_{h}$ identification uncertainty of $\frac{20\% \times p_{\text{T}}}{\text{TeV}}$
is applied to account for the extrapolation from the tau ID efficiency
measurement, which uses mostly taus close to the Z peak, to taus with higher \pT s. This
uncertainty is applied to signal and backgrounds with real taus in the \etau, \mutau and \tautau channels
\subsubsection*{Top quark \pT~ reweighting}
To account for the uncertainty in the derivation of the top-quark \pT~ reweighting, a shape
uncertainty is applied to the \ttbar background. This uncertainty amounts to a 100\% variation
of the correction, ie the difference between applying the correction twice and not applying the correction at all.
\subsubsection*{Drell-Yan shape reweighting}
An uncertainty on the Drell-Yan shape reweighting based on \Zmm events
is applied as 100\% of the correction to the \Ztautau background \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037}. 
\subsubsection*{Jet$\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$ fake rate shape reweighting}
On the \Wjets background in the \etau and \mutau channels a shape 
uncertainty of $\frac{-20\% \times p_{\text{T}}}{\text{GeV}}$ is 
applied. This uncertainty is derived from variations in the data/MC ratio
for the jet$\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$ fake rate as a function of jet \pT~ in 
\Wjets events \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037}.

\section{Signal extraction}
\label{sec:mssm_signalextraction}
The total transverse mass \mTtot~ is used as discriminating variable in this analysis.
All bins of the distribution are used to perform a shape analysis. The statistical
methods, including the incorporation of nuisance parameters in the fit, were already
described in section \ref{sec:hhh_results_extraction}. Some additional
methods are used for this analysis, and they will be discussed in this section.

\subsection{Inclusion of control regions in the fit}
\label{sec:mssm_sigext_ctrl}
The control regions used for estimation of the 
\Wjets and QCD background contributions in the signal regions, discussed
in section \ref{sec:mssm_bkgs_etmt_ctrl}, are included in the fit. They
are added to the likelihood as single-bin counting experiments. In a given
category of one of the channels, the \Wjets
normalisation is fully correlated between the three control 
regions and the signal region. One common, freely floating, nuisance parameter
controls the \Wjets normalisation in all four regions. The QCD normalisation
is fully correlated between the opposite--sign high and low \mT~ regions. The
same is true for the same--sign high and low \mT regions. This means there are
two freely floating nuisance parameters that govern the QCD normalisation: one
that controls the QCD normalisation in the two opposite--sign regions, and one
that controls it in the two same--sign regions. 

The \Zmm control regions mentioned in section \ref{sec:mssm_bkgs_ztt}
are also included in the likelihood as single-bin counting experiments.
The \Zmm control region in the no b-tag category is tied
to the \Ztautau normalisation in the no b-tag categories of all four
channels, again being controlled by a freely floating nuisance parameter. 
The same is true for the \Zmm control region in the b-tag category
and the \Ztautau normalisation in the b-tag categories of all four channels.

\subsection{Signal process profiling and 2D likelihood scans}
\label{sec:mssm_sigext_profile}
Because the analysis targets the two main MSSM production modes, gluon fusion and
b-associated production, limits are set on these two signal processes. As we
have seen in section WHATEVER we cannot fully separate the two signals by means
of the categorisation used. 
However, in the upper limits on cross--section times branching ratio for the $gg\phi$
process we should not make any assumptions about the presence or lack of the $bb\phi$
process and vice versa. Therefore when calculating the upper limits on the $gg\phi$
process, the contribution of the $bb\phi$ process is added to the fit as a freely floating nuisance
parameter, and vice versa, in a process referred to as signal process profiling. 

Because these two signal processes are targeted by this analysis, it is possible
to re-define the likelihood as a function of both the gg$\phi$ and bb$\phi$ signals:
\begin{equation}\label{mssm_2D_likelihood}
\mathcal{L}(\text{data}|\mu_{gg\phi},\mu_{bb\phi}, \theta) = \mathcal{L}(\text{data}|\mu_{gg\phi} \cdot s_{gg\phi}(\theta) + \mu_{bb\phi}\cdot s_{bb\phi}(\theta) + b(\theta)),
\end{equation}
where $s_{gg\phi}$ and $s_{bb\phi}$ are the signal expectations of the two
production processes and the signal strength modifiers $\mu_{gg\phi}$ and $\mu_{bb\phi}$ now represent the cross--section times branching ratio of the
processes. Using this definition we can now perform a likelihood scan in two dimensions by 
constructing a two-dimensional grid in $\mu_{gg\phi}$ and $\mu_{bb\phi}$, both required to be greater than or equal to 0. 
The negative log-likelihood,
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:nll}
\text{NLL} = -\text{ln}\mathcal{L}(\text{data}|\mu_{gg\phi},\mu_{bb\phi},\theta)
\end{equation}
is then evaluated at each point. The point in the 2D grid where the NLL reaches
its lowest value gives the best fit value for $\mu_{gg\phi}$ and $\mu_{bb\phi}$.
68\% and 95\% confidence intervals are constructed as the values
$\mu_{gg\phi}^{N\%}$ and $\mu_{bb\phi}^{N\%}$ for which:
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mssm_2D_deltaNLL}
\begin{split}
\Delta(\text{NLL})_{68\%} = \text{NLL}(\text{best fit}) - \text{NLL}(\mu_{gg\phi}^{68\%},\mu_{bb\phi}^{68\%}) = 0.5, ~\\
\Delta(\text{NLL})_{95\%} = \text{NLL}(\text{best fit}) - \text{NLL}(\mu_{gg\phi}^{95\%},\mu_{bb\phi}^{95\%}) = 1.92,
\end{split}
\end{equation}

\subsection{MSSMvsSM hypothesis testing}
\label{sec:mssm_sigext_mssmvssm}
The results of the search are interpreted in MSSM benchmark
scenarios, with the interpretation made in the \mA-\tanb~ plane.
At each point in the \mA-\tanb~ plane each MSSM scenario
predicts a production cross section, and corresponding branching
ratio into $\Pgt\Pgt$, for each of the three neutral Higgs bosons. The
masses of the light h and the scalar H are also given as a function of \mA~ and \tanb.
To interpret the results of this search in a particular scenario, the predicted
signal from the three neutral Higgs bosons is combined into a single signal template.
Examples of what such a combined signal profile might look like are given in figures \ref{fig:mssm_results_mttot_mt}--\ref{fig:mssm_results_mttot_em},
which give the \mTtot~ distributions for all channels and categories with an example three-Higgs signal overlaid.
The compatibility of the data with all three Higgs bosons, not just a single one, is thus tested.

Simply comparing a three-Higgs-signal-plus-background hypothesis with a background-only 
hypothesis to determine the exclusion power of the search in a particular
model can be problematic. Due to the existence of a Higgs boson with a 
mass of 125 GeV, all MSSM benchmark scenarios must include a light Higgs boson
with very similar properties to the boson discovered during Run 1 of the \ac{LHC}.
This means that we should do a test that distinguishes between three-Higgs-signal-plus-background, and
standard model Higgs-signal-plus-background.

This means the likelihood function defined in equation \ref{eqn:hhh_likelihood}
must be modified. Instead of testing for the compatibility of the data with
a signal + background expectation modified by the signal strenght modifier $\mu$ as
$\mu \cdot s(\theta) + b(\theta)$, a likelihood must be constructed as:
\begin{equation}\label{mssm_likelihood}
\mathcal{L}(\text{data}|\mu, \theta) = \mathcal{L}(\text{data}|\mu \cdot s_{\text{MSSM}}(\theta) + (1-\mu)\cdot s_{\text{SM}}(\theta) + b(\theta)),
\end{equation}
where $s_{\text{MSSM}}(\theta)$ corresponds to the MSSM signal expectation, ie the three-Higgs-signal, and $s_{\text{SM}}(\theta)$ 
corresponds to the SM signal expectation.
The signal strength modifier $\mu$ takes the role of distinguishing between
the two hypothesis in this case. The model cannot allow for the coexistence 
of the SM and MSSM hypotheses; the MSSM hypothesis ($\mu=1$) is tested
against the SM hypothesis ($\mu=0$).

The modification of the likelihood function means it is no longer possible
to use the profile likelihood ratio of equation \ref{eqn:hhh_profilelikelihood}:
we are forced to test $\mu=1$ against $\mu=0$ and 
$\hat{\mu}$ in the denominator of equation \ref{eqn:hhh_profilelikelihood} is in 
general not 0. A solution to this problem can be found in test statistic used at the Tevatron \cite{LHCHComb2011},
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mssm_tevatron_teststat}
q_{\mu} = -2\text{ln}\frac{\mathcal{L}(\text{data}|\mu,\hat{\theta_{\mu}})}{\mathcal{L}(\text{data}|0,\hat{\theta_0}} \text{ with } 0\leq\mu.
\end{equation}
In this test statistic we test a positive value of $\mu$ against 0, thus we are able to define
the desired `MSSMvsSM' test statistic as
\begin{equation}\label{eqn:mssm_mssmvssm_stat}
q_{\text{MSSMvsSM}} = -2\text{ln}\frac{\mathcal{L}(\text{data}|s_{\text{MSSM}}(\theta) + b(\theta)}{\mathcal{L}(\text{data}|s_{\text{SM}}(\theta)+b(\theta)}.
\end{equation}

The asymptotic approximation, discussed in section \ref{sec:hhh_results_extraction}, can not be applied
to the Tevatron test statistic, and therefore the probability density functions need to be generated 
with toy datasets. Using these pdfs we can then calculate $CL_s{\mu=1}$ as defined in equation \ref{eqn:hhh_cls}.
If $CL_s < 0.05$ the MSSM hypothesis is excluded at 95 \% CL. This generation of toy datasets and 
calculation of corresponding $CL_s$ value is performed for many points in a grid in the \mA-\tanb~ plane,
with interpolation between grid points performed to obtain a smooth exclusion contour.
The distribution of toy datasets for the SM and MSSM hypothesis, as well as the resulting $CL_s$ values,
are given for three \mA-\tanb~ points in figure \ref{fig:mssm_mssmvssm_toys}. In figure \ref{fig:mssm_mssmvssm_toys}a
there is no separation between the MSSM and SM toy distributions, and so we cannot exclude this point. The separation
between the distributions in figure \ref{fig:mssm_mssmvssm_toys}b is much improved, and the observation is most compatible
with the SM hypothesis. This point is on the edge of being excluded. Finally the distributions in figure \ref{fig:mssm_mssmvssm_toys}c
are very well separated, and the observation is compatible with the SM hypothesis, meaning this point of the parameter space is excluded.

\section{Results}
\label{sec:mssm_results}

\subsection{Model--independent results}
\label{sec:mssm_results_modelindep}
The \mTtot~ distributions in the no b-tag and b-tag
categories of all channels, after the fit to the observed
data has been performed, are shown in figures \ref{fig:mssm_results_mttot_mt}--\ref{fig:mssm_results_mttot_em}.
The signal of the 3 neutral Higgs bosons at \mA=1 TeV and \tanb=50 in the $m_{h}^{mod+}$ scenario is overlaid 
on the total transverse mass distributions. The signal peaks twice due to the presence of a light Higgs boson
with mass compatible with 125 GeV in this model, which is necessary to incorporate the Higgs boson
observed at 125 GeV into the model.

\begin{figure}[h!]

None of these distributions show hints of a significant excess. The
95\% upper limits on $\sigma\times$BR are shown in figure \ref{fig:mssm_results_limits}a
for gluon--gluon fusion and in figure \ref{fig:mssm_results_limits}b for b--associated
production. All channels and categories are combined.

A comparison of the expected limits
per channel is shown in figure \ref{fig:mssm_results_limits_breakdown}a for gg$\phi$ production
and in figure \ref{fig:mssm_results_limits_breakdown}b for bb$\phi$ production.
These figures show that the \mutau channel is the most sensitive at masses up to 
200 GeV, beyond which the \tautau channel becomes more sensitive. The \etau
channel is always slightly less sensitivie than the \mutau channel. The \emu channel
is the least sensitive over a large part of the parameter space, until it overtakes the 
\etau channel in sensitivity at 1.6 TeV and is slightly more sensitive than the
\mutau channel at 3.2 TeV. The \emu channel becomes more sensitive at higher masses as
a narrower binning of the \mTtot~ distribution is possible than for the other channels.
The \mTtot~ distribution for the high mass signals is therefore wide enough not to
fall entirely into the last bin used for the fit. This means at high mass this channel
benefits more from the shape discrimination between signal and backgrounds than
the other channels.

\end{figure}

\subsection{Sensitivity to the Standard Model Higgs boson}
\label{sec:mssm_results_125GeV}
As we set limits on MSSM Higgs boson production 
down to masses of 90 GeV it is important to consider possible sensitivity
to the 125 GeV Higgs boson. As the cross--section times branching ratio for gluon-fusion
production of the 125 GeV Higgs boson in the standard model, with decay into $\Pgt\Pgt$
is 3.05 pb \cite{YR4} and the expected limit on cross--section times
branching ratio for MSSM gg$\phi$ production at around 125 GeV is around 20 pb
the analysis is not yet sensitive to the SM Higgs boson. The
limits shown in figure \ref{fig:mssm_results_greenband},
which include the standard model Higgs boson as part of the backgrounds,
are almost exactly the same as those shown in figure \ref{fig:mssm_results_limits}. This
also indicates the current lack of sensitivity to the standard model Higgs boson.

\subsection{2D likelihood scans}
\label{sec:mssm_results_2D}
The 2D likelihood scans, as described in section \ref{sec:mssm_sigext_profile}, for
a few mass points are shown in figure \ref{fig:mssm_results_2D_scans},
for four mass points ranging from 100 GeV to 3.2 TeV. From the shape of the contours
we can see the correlation between the gg$\phi$ and bb$\phi$ processes, in a show of
the fact that we cannot fully disentangle the two processes.

\subsection{Interpretation in MSSM benchmark scenarios}
\label{sec:mssm_results_modeldep}
The results are interpreted in two MSSM benchmark scenarios: the $m_{\text{h}}^{\text{mod+}}$
scenario and the hMSSM scenario. Both scenarios are described in chapter THEORY.

Figure \ref{fig:mssm_mhmodp_2016} shows the expected (dashed line and grey bands) and
observed (blue shaded area bounded by solid line) exclusion of the search presented in this chapter
in the \mA-\tanb~ plane of the $m_{\text{h}}^{\text{mod+}}$ scenario. The red shaded band
indicates the area that is excluded due to the lack of a light Higgs boson with a mass compatible
with 125 GeV. Compared with the most sensitive limits set during Run 1 of the \ac{LHC} these
limits at high \tanb~ have improved by around 300 GeV.

\begin{figure}[h!]

\end{center}
\caption{Exclusion in the $m_{h}^{\text{mod}+}$ scenario obtained by the combination
of all channels in the \AHtotautau analysis. The blue shaded area bounded by the 
solid black line is the observed exclusion, with the dashed black line the
expected exclusion. The grey bands indicate the $\pm 1,2$ $\sigma$ 
expected exclusion. The red shaded area
is excluded by the lack of a light Higgs boson with mass compatible with 125 GeV \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037}.}
\label{fig:mssm_mhmodp_2016}
\end{figure}

Figure \ref{fig:mssm_hmssm_2016} shows the expected (dashed line and grey bands)
and observed (blue shaded area bounded by solid line) exclusion of the search
presented in this chapter in the \mA-\tanb~ plane of the hMSSM scenario. 
We should note again that this model, although defined for \tanb~ values
upwards of 10, is only strictly valid for \tanb~ below 10.
The small excluded area around \mA=200 GeV is genuine. It is caused by the 
production cross-section times branching ratio in the model, which is driven by
two effects \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-007}. On the one hand the branching ratio into taus decreases with decreasing
\tanb~, while on the other hand a negative top--bottom interference effect increases the
gluon--gluon fusion cross-section with decreasing \tanb~. Therefore the
combined cross--section times branching ratio decreases with decreasing \tanb, until it
increases again from a low value of \tanb~ down to \tanb=1. The feature is 
thus expected to grow with more data.

expected exclusion \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-037}.}

\section{Combination of 2015 and 2016 datasets}
\label{sec:mssm_combination}
The results outlined in the previous section, for the analysis
on a dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 12.9 fb$^{-1}$
at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV, collected during the 2016 running period
of the \ac{LHC}, can be combined with the results from a very similar analysis
performed on 2.3 fb$^{-1}$ collected at 13 TeV during 2015, detailed
in reference \cite{CMS-PAS-HIG-16-006}. This combination should be able
to improve slighty on the limits set by the 2016 analysis. Because the 
analysis on the 2015 dataset is very similar to the 2016 analysis it 
is not described in detail, however, the results will
be presented, and key differences with the more recent result highlighted
where needed.

\subsection{Results from 2015 analysis}
\label{sec:mssm_combination_2015}
The results from the search for \AHtotautau on a
dataset corresponding to an integrated luminosity of 2.3 fb$^{-1}$
collected at a centre-of-mass energy of 13 TeV during 2015 are presented
in this section. As for the analysis discussed earlier
in the chapter a shape analysis is performed, however a different
discriminating variable, the transverse component of the di-$\Pgt$ mass
as reconstructed using the SVFit algorithm, was used. This variable
is denoted $m_{\text{T,\Pgt\Pgt}}$. The transverse di-$\Pgt$ mass 
distributions for the four channels are shown in figures \ref{fig:mssm_hig16006_mtsv_mt} -- \ref{fig:mssm_hig16006_mtsv_em}.

These distributions do not show any significant excesses. The upper limits
on cross--section times branching ratio for the gluon-fusion and b-associated
process are shown in figure \ref{fig:mssm_results_hig16006_limits}a
and b, respectively. All channels and categories are combined. A comparison of
the expected limits per channel is given in figure \ref{fig:mssm_results_limits_breakdown_hig16006}.
These follow a similar pattern to those given in figure \ref{gi:mssm_results_limits_breakdown}, notice
however the \emu channel remains the least sensitive even at very high mass, as the
transverse component of the di-$\Pgt$ mass exhibits a sizeable \ttbar tail in the \emu channel. The total
transverse mass collapses events from the tail into lower regions of the distribution.

\subsection{Combination procedure}
\label{sec:mssm_combination_procedure}
The idea of combining the two analyses is to combine the 
individual likelihoods to improve the analysis sensitivity and
physics reach. To do this correctly the correlations between
nuisance parameters in 2015 and 2016 need to be taken into account.
%Strictly, studies into the underlying correlations between
%nuisance parameters should be performed. This is however not always
%feasible and in some cases
The correlation scheme between nuisance parameters relating to the 2015 and 2016
analyses, as used for this combination, is given in table ADD TABLE.

\begin{table}[htp]
\begin{center}
\caption{Correlations between nuisance parameters in 2015 and 2016 analysis}
\begin{tabular}{@{}lll@{}}
%\toprule
\textbf{Nuisance} & \textbf{Correlation} & \textbf{Motivation}\\
\midrule
Luminosity & Partially correlated & As studied by the relevant people in the experiment\\
Jet energy scale & Fully correlated & Found to be so by those responsible for it in the experiment\\
b-tagging & Uncorrelated & Scale factors used in 2015 and 2016 analysis measured via different methods\\
mis-tagging & Part correlated & As recommended by those measuring b-tagging scale factors\\
Muon ID/isolation/trigger & Uncorrelated & The 2015 and 2016 analyses use different muon ID and isolation working points, and the \ac{L1} trigger was replaced completely between 2015 and 2016\\
Electron ID/isolation/trigger & Uncorrelated & The \ac{L1} trigger was completely replaced between 2015 and 2016\\
Tau ID/isolation/trigger& Uncorrelated & On top of the replacement of the \ac{L1} trigger, a tau ID scale factor was applied in the 2016 analysis but not in the 2015 analysis, despite the fact that the yield should have been brought down by around 8\% for the 2015 analysis\\
High \pT tau ID efficiency & Correlated & This should not be affected by the lack of tau ID scale factor and covers teh same underlying issue in both analyses\\
Tau energy scale & Correlated & There is no reason to expect a different best-fit energy scale between 2015 and 2016\\
Drell-Yan shape & Correlated & The same \ac{MC} samples, exhibiting the observed discrepancies, is used. In addition the weights as derived for the 2015 analysis and the 2016 analysis are very similar\\
W jet$\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$ fake rate shape & Uncorrelated & Correction not applied in the 2016 dataset while it was applied for the 2015 analysis. The uncertainties have a different functional form, possibly due to different jet$\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$ fake rates as a result of the use of a different tau isolation working point\\
MET uncertainties & Correlated & The same MVA \MET training was used both for 2015 and 2016\\
Top quark \pT reweighting & Correlated & The same corrections were applied to the 2015 and 2016 analyses\\
Drell-Yan cross section & Correlated & Theoretical uncertainty so should be correlated\\
Di--boson cross section & Correlated & Theoretical uncertainty so should be correlated\\
\ttbar cross section & Correlated & Theoretical uncertainty so should be correlated\\
\Wjets cross section & Correlated & Theoretical uncertainty so should be correlated\\
SM signal theory uncertainties & Correlated & Theoretical uncertainties so should be correlated\\
\Ztautau acceptance & - & Uncertainty only exists in 2015 analysis as no fits to the \Zmm control region were included yet\\
\Ztautau extrapolation& - & Uncertainty only exists in 2016 analysis as fits to the \Zmm control regions were included and this uncertainty should cover only the extrapolation from \Zmm to \Ztautau, not the full acceptance\\
e$\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$ fake rate & Correlated & Expect to behave the same in 2015 and 2016 datasets\\
$\mu\rightarrow\Pgt_{h}$ fake rate & Uncorrelated & Measurement had not been made at time of 2015 analysis and so no scale factors were applied yet\\

\subsection{Results}
\label{sec:mssm_combination_results}
The expected and observed upper limits on cross--section times branching ratio,
for the combination of the 2015 and 2016 analyses, are shown in figure
\ref{fig:mssm_results_combination_limits}. The limits behave as expected
from the individual 2015 and 2016 limits. 

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
\subfloat[gg$\phi$]{\includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{MSSM/Figures/mssm_combination_090117_ggH_cmb.png}}

\caption{Upper limits at 95\% CL for (a) the gluon--gluon fusion production
process and (b) the b--associated production process. These results
combine all categories and all four final states from both the 2015
and the 2016 analysis.}
\label{fig:mssm_results_combination_limits}
\end{figure}

To get a better idea of which analysis
is driving the sensitivity of the combination, we should consider the comparison
of expected limits in figure \ref{fig:mssm_results_combination_limits_comp}. The
gluon-fusion limits in figure \ref{fig:mssm_results_combination_limits_comp}a show that at
higher masses the analysis sensitivity is only very slightly improved with respect to the 
analysis of the 12.9 fb$^{-1}$ dataset. However, for masses between 200 and 800 GeV
there is a larger improvement in analysis sensitivity from combining the two analyses.
This is expected since the analysis on the 2016 dataset used a slightly different
selection that made the analysis more optimal at masses above 800 GeV,
and slightly less optimal below this mass, than the analysis on the 2015 dataset. This
effect is less visible on the b--associated production limits shown in figure \ref{fig:mssm_results_combination_limits_comp}b.
